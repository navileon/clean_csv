"Recommitting to our why, what, and how","Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, shared the below communication with Microsoft employees this morning.

As we begin a new fiscal year, I’ve been reflecting on the road we’ve traveled together and the path ahead.

Before anything else, I want to speak to what’s been weighing heavily on me, and what I know many of you are thinking about: the recent job eliminations. These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we’ve worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends.

I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful.

I also want to acknowledge the uncertainty and seeming incongruence of the times we’re in. By every objective measure, Microsoft is thriving—our market performance, strategic positioning, and growth all point up and to the right. We’re investing more in CapEx than ever before. Our overall headcount is relatively unchanged, and some of the talent and expertise in our industry and at Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before. And yet, at the same time, we’ve undergone layoffs.

This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value. Progress isn’t linear. It’s dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it’s also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before.

The success we want to achieve will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of “unlearning” and “learning.” It requires us to meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function. This is inherently hard, and few companies can do both.

But I have full confidence that we can, and we will once again find the resolve, courage, and clarity to deliver on our mission in this new paradigm.

With that context, I want to re-ground ourselves in our why, what, and how: our mission, our priorities, and our culture.

Our why: mission 

What does achieving our mission look like and feel like for us as a company? When Microsoft is succeeding, the world around us must succeed too. This is why each of us chose to be here, and as a company it’s how we earn our social permission to operate. When Bill founded Microsoft, he envisioned not just a software company, but a software factory, unconstrained by any single product or category. That idea has guided us for decades. But today, it’s no longer enough.

We must reimagine our mission for a new era. What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It’s not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It’s about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That’s the shift we are driving—from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve.

Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them. And consider how organizations, empowered with AI, could unlock entirely new levels of agility and innovation by transforming decision-making, streamlining operations, and enabling every team to achieve more together than ever before.

That’s the empowerment our mission enables, creating local surplus in every company, community, and country. And that’s our opportunity ahead.

Our what: priorities 

To deliver on our mission, we need to stay focused on our three business priorities: security, quality, and AI transformation.

We are doubling down on the fundamentals while continuing to define new frontiers in AI.

Security and quality are non-negotiable. Our infrastructure and services are mission critical for the world, and without them we don’t have permission to move forward.

We’ve made substantial progress across SFI, QEI, and Engineering Thrive this year, and they remain top priorities to ensure that we continuously improve our innovation velocity and our operational metrics.

We will reimagine every layer of the tech stack for AI—infrastructure, to the app platform, to apps and agents. The key is to get the platform primitives right for these new workloads and for the next order of magnitude of scale. Our differentiation will come from how we bring these layers together to deliver end-to-end experiences and products, with the core ethos of a platform company that fosters ecosystem opportunity broadly. Getting both the product and platform right for the AI wave is our North Star!

Our performance this past year has positioned us well. And we must move forward with the intentionality and intensity that these industry shifts demand.

Our how: culture

Growth mindset has served us well over the last decade—the everyday practice of being a learn-it-all, not a know-it-all. It has reshaped our culture and helped us lead with greater humility and empathy. We need to keep that.

It starts with each of us as individuals and our personal drive to learn, improve, and get better every day. Professional rewards, growth, and pride in our craft will always be the prime drivers. Beyond that, we each have the opportunity to connect our personal passion and philosophy of how we derive meaning from the work we do with Microsoft’s mission to empower the world. This is what makes it all worthwhile.

This platform shift is reshaping not only the products we build and the business models we operate under, but also how we are structured and how we work together every day. It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere. It reminds me of the early ’90s, when PCs and productivity software became standard in every home and every desk! That’s exactly where we are now with AI.

Years from now, when you look back at your time here, I hope you’ll say: “That’s when I learned the most. That’s when I made my biggest impact. That’s when I was part of something transformational.”

What we’ve learned over the past five decades is that success is not about longevity. It’s about relevance. Our future won’t be defined by what we’ve built before, but by what we empower others to build now.

And I know that with your dedication, drive, and hard work we can go win together, and change the world in the process.

I look forward to sharing more at Earnings next week and addressing your questions at our next Town Hall.

Satya

From AI-driven automation to seamless cloud integration and more, it’s exciting to see how developers are fueling the next generation of digital transformation.
So, what’s next?
We envision a world in which agents operate across individual, organizational, team and end-to-end business contexts. This emerging vision of the internet is an open agentic web, where AI agents make decisions and perform tasks on behalf of users or organizations.
At Microsoft Build we’re showing the steps we’re taking to make this vision a reality through our platforms, products and infrastructure. We’re putting new models and coding agents in the hands of developers, introducing enterprise-grade agents, making our platforms like Azure AI Foundry, GitHub and Windows the best places to build, embracing open protocols and accelerating scientific discovery with AI, all so that developers and organizations can go invent the next big thing.
Here’s a glimpse at just a few of the announcements today:
Reimagining the software development lifecycle with AI
AI is fundamentally shifting how code is written, deployed and maintained. Developers are using AI to stay in the flow of their environment longer and to shift their focus to more strategic tasks. And as the software development lifecycle is being transformed, we’re providing new features across platforms including GitHub, Azure AI Foundry and Windows that enable developers to work faster, think bigger and build at scale.

GitHub Copilot coding agent and new updates to GitHub Models: GitHub Copilot is evolving from an in-editor assistant to an agentic AI partner with a first-of-its-kind asynchronous coding agent integrated into the GitHub platform. We’re adding prompt management, lightweight evaluations and enterprise controls to GitHub Models so teams can experiment with best-in-class models, without leaving GitHub. Microsoft is also open-sourcing GitHub Copilot Chat in VS Code.

To learn more visit our Windows Developer Blog.


Azure AI Foundry Models and new tools for model evaluation: Azure AI Foundry is a unified platform for developers to design, customize and manage AI applications and agents. With Azure AI Foundry Models, we’re bringing Grok 3 and Grok 3 mini models from xAI to our ecosystem, hosted and billed directly by Microsoft. Developers can now choose from more than 1,900 partner-hosted and Microsoft-hosted AI models, while managing secure data integration, model customization and enterprise-grade governance. We’re also introducing new tools like the Model Leaderboard, which ranks the top-performing AI models across different categories and tasks, and the Model Router, designed to select an optimal model for a specific query or task in real-time. Read more about Azure AI Foundry Models.

Making AI agents more capable and secure
AI agents are not only changing how developers build, but how individuals, teams and companies get work done. At Build, we’re unveiling new pre-built agents, custom agent building blocks, multi-agent capabilities and new models to help developers and organizations build and deploy agents securely to help increase productivity in meaningful ways.

With the general availability of Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, Microsoft is bringing new capabilities to empower professional developers to orchestrate multiple specialized agents to handle complex tasks, including bringing Semantic Kernel and AutoGen into a single, developer-focused SDK and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) support. To help developers build trust and confidence in their AI agents, we’re announcing new features in Azure AI Foundry Observability for built-in observability into metrics for performance, quality, cost and safety, all incorporated alongside detailed tracing in a streamlined dashboard. Learn more about how to deploy enterprise-grade AI agents in Azure AI Foundry Service.


Discover, protect and govern in Azure AI Foundry: With Microsoft Entra Agent ID, now in preview, agents that developers create in Microsoft Copilot Studio or Azure AI Foundry are automatically assigned unique identities in an Entra directory, helping enterprises securely manage agents right from the start and avoid “agent sprawl” that could lead to blind spots. Apps and agents built with Foundry further benefit from Purview data security and compliance controls. Foundry also offers enhanced governance tools to set risk parameters, run automated evaluations and receive detailed reports. Learn more about Microsoft Entra Agent ID and Azure AI Foundry integrations with Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager.


Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot Tuning and multi-agent orchestration: With Copilot Tuning, customers can use their own company data, workflows and processes to train models and create agents in a simple, low-code way. These agents perform highly accurate, domain-specific tasks securely from within the Microsoft 365 service boundary. For example, a law firm can create an agent that generates documents aligned with its organization’s expertise and style. Additionally, new multi-agent orchestration in Copilot Studio connects multiple agents, allowing them to combine skills and tackle broader, more complex tasks. Check out the Microsoft 365 blog to learn how to access these new tools as well as the Microsoft 365 Copilot Wave 2 spring release, which has moved to general availability and begins rolling out today.

Supporting the open agentic web
To realize the future of AI agents, we’re advancing open standards and shared infrastructure to provide unique capabilities for customers.

Supporting Model Context Protocol (MCP): Microsoft is delivering broad first-party support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) across its agent platform and frameworks, spanning GitHub, Copilot Studio, Dynamics 365, Azure AI Foundry, Semantic Kernel and Windows 11. In addition, Microsoft and GitHub have joined the MCP Steering Committee to help advance secure, at-scale adoption of the open protocol and announced two new contributions to the MCP ecosystem, an updated authorization specification, which enables people to use their existing trusted sign-in methods to give agents and LLM-powered apps access to data and services such as personal storage drives or subscription services, and the design of an MCP server registry service, which allows anyone to implement public or private, up-to-date, centralized repositories for MCP server entries. Check out the GitHub repository. As we expand our MCP capabilities, our top priority is to ensure we’re building upon a secure foundation. To learn more about this approach see: Securing the Model Context Protocol: Building a Safe Agentic Future on Windows.


A new open project called NLWeb: Microsoft is introducing NLWeb, which we believe can play a similar role to HTML for the agentic web. NLWeb makes it easy for websites to provide a conversational interface for their users with the model of their choice and their own data, allowing users to interact directly with web content in a rich, semantic manner. Every NLWeb endpoint is also an MCP server, so websites can make their content easily discoverable and accessible to AI agents if they choose. Learn more here.

How agentic AI is driving AI-first business transformation for customers to achieve more,"The role of agentic AI has grown rapidly over the past several months as organizational leaders seek ways to accelerate AI Transformation. We firmly believe that Agents + Copilot + Human Ambition can deliver real AI differentiation for our customers. By putting the autonomous capabilities of an agent to work for their businesses, our customers are unlocking AI opportunity to realize greater value. The recent introduction of Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat is delivering on our promise of “Copilot for all” by providing frontline workers with a free, secure and enterprise-ready AI chat interface. Our customers are building their own custom agents with the no-code, low-code features of Microsoft Copilot Studio, allowing citizen and professional developers to extend the capabilities of Copilot and deliver on the unique needs of their industry. We also offer the best prebuilt agent framework right out-of-the-box, such as Sales Agent that works autonomously to help sellers build pipeline and close more deals with greater speed. Similarly, we recently announced general purpose reasoning agents — such as Researcher and Analyst — and invite all of our Microsoft 365 Copilot users to try these in their environments.

It is exciting to see how agents are driving pragmatic AI innovation for our customers by increasing productivity, creating capacity across every role and function and improving business processes. Below are a few highlights from the past quarter that underscore the impact of an agentic AI approach — from improving employee experiences to streamlined workflows and significant cost savings.

Agentic service management software provider Atomicwork leveraged Azure AI Foundry to create Atom — an AI agent that transforms the digital workplace experience for employees and automates service delivery. Adopters of this agentic management platform recognize significant benefits, such as reduced operational costs and increased employee satisfaction, with one customer achieving a 65% deflection rate within six months of implementation and projections of 80% by the end of the year. Integration within Microsoft Teams and other enterprise tools have further streamlined service delivery, allowing employees easier access to information and support. The company’s AI-driven approach has resulted in a 20% increase in accuracy and 75% reduction in response latency when compared to competing solutions.

To support employees as they manage the high demand of internal requests and to create a more satisfying work environment, BDO Colombia used Copilot Studio and Power Platform to develop BeTic 2.0 — an agent that centralizes and automates key payroll and finance processes. The agent reduced operational workload by 50%, optimized 78% of internal processes and showed 99.9% accuracy in managed requests. It also helped reduce duplicative work, optimized workflows, improved the employee-client experience and continues to serve as a competitive differentiator for the company in the market.

Dow is using agents to automate the shipping invoice analysis process and streamline its global supply chain to unlock new efficiencies and value. Receiving more than 100,000 shipping invoices via PDF each year, Dow built an autonomous agent in Copilot Studio to scan for billing inaccuracies and surface them in a dashboard for employee review. Using Freight Agent — a second agent built in Copilot Studio — employees can investigate further by “dialoguing with the data” in natural language. The agents are helping employees solve the challenge of hidden losses autonomously within minutes rather than weeks or months. Dow expects to save millions of dollars on shipping costs through increased accuracy in logistic rates and billing within the first year.

As a leading provider of sustainable energy in Belgium, Eneco serves over 1.5 million customers. Facing performance issues with their existing chatbot, Eneco developed a new AI-driven agent using the no-code, graphical interface in Copilot Studio. This multilingual agent was deployed on the company website in just three months, integrating seamlessly with its live chat platform. The new agent manages 24,000 chats per month — an increase of 140% over the previous solution — and resolves 70% more customer conversations without a handoff to a live representative. For requests that do require escalation, the agent provides an AI-generated summary of the conversation for a more optimized call center experience.

To reimagine trend forecasting and consumer marketing, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. leveraged Copilot Studio to develop ConsumerIQ — an agent that centralizes and streamlines consumer data to enable instant access to actionable insights. Using natural language prompts, the agent reduced the time required for marketers to gather data from hours to seconds, while accelerating decision-making and helping prevent duplicated research. Together with Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search, teams can gather data, identify trends, build marketing assets, inform research and move products to market faster.

To create proposals and streamline knowledge retrieval and organization, Fujitsu leveraged Azure AI Agent Service within Azure AI Foundry to develop an intelligent, scalable AI agent for sales automation. The agent boosted productivity of sales teams by 67% while addressing knowledge gaps and allowing them to build stronger customer relationships. This transformation allowed teams to shift from time-intensive tasks to strategic planning and customer relationship building, while also supporting new hires with product information and strategic guidance.

To reduce manual tasks and help employees deliver exceptional experiences, global baker Grupo Bimbo established its first ever technology Center of Excellence. Using Power Platform solutions and Copilot Studio, teams created 7,000 power apps, 18,000 processes and 650 agents to reduce busy work and enhance consumer service. By automating low-value tasks, the company saved tens of millions of dollars annually in development efforts and operational efficiencies. Grupo Bimbo also migrated to Azure for its AI capabilities, scalability, security and rapid time to market for apps.

KPMG developed Comply AI — an agent that helps identify environment, social and governance compliance. Using Microsoft AI technologies, the agent helps identify relevant obligations, generate statements in natural language, assess control effectiveness and redraft control descriptions. This has already helped one of its customers achieve 70% improvement in Controls and Risks descriptions, an 18-month reduction in compliance program timelines and a 50% cut in ongoing compliance efforts. KPMG is also using an agent to support new hires by providing templates and historical references to speed up the onboarding process and reduce follow-up calls by 20%.

To significantly enhance its customer service operations, T-Mobile used Power Apps to develop PromoGenius — an app that combines promotional data from multiple systems and documents to keep frontline retail employees equipped with the latest promotional information for customers. Using Copilot Studio, the company embedded an agent in the app so customer service representatives can instantly search for technical details from device manufacturers and create a customer-facing view of product information in a fraction of the time a manual search would require. PromoGenius is the second most-used app in the company, with 83,000 unique users and 500,000 launches a month.

Using Copilot Studio, Virgin Money developed Redi — an agent serving as a digital host within a mobile app for credit card customers. The agent, trained to understand colloquialisms and even known to tell jokes, serves as a secure way for customers to get answers quickly while understanding appropriate context for when a live representative is required. The company views this agent as a tool for its employees to better serve customers, handling over one million interactions, boosting customer satisfaction and becoming one of the bank’s top-rated service channels. Redi now supports customers across Virgin Money’s digital platforms and has been recognized with an industry award for AI in financial services.

To help employees navigate countless procedures, evolving regulations and complex banking systems, Wells Fargo built an agent through Teams to ensure fast and accurate customer support. Using large language models, the agent provides instant access to guidance on 1,700 internal procedures across 4,000 bank branches. Employees can now locate needed information faster without support from a colleague, with 75% of searches happening through the agent and response times reduced from 10 minutes to 30 seconds.

There is immense potential for agents to drive AI-first differentiation for organizations everywhere, especially when combined with Copilot and human ambition. At Microsoft, we believe AI is about empowering human achievement, unlocking potential and democratizing intelligence for as many people as possible with our cloud and AI solutions — as evidenced by these AI Transformation stories of more than 700 customers and partners. I look forward to partnering with you to unlock continued AI opportunity, drive pragmatic innovation and realize meaningful business impact for your organization.

The 2025 Annual Work Trend Index: The Frontier Firm is born,"We are entering a new reality — one in which AI can reason and solve problems in remarkable ways. This intelligence on tap will rewrite the rules of business and transform knowledge work as we know it. Like the Industrial Revolution and the internet era, this transformation will take decades to show its full promise — and will bring broad technological, societal and economic change.

The 2025 Work Trend Index Annual Report is designed to prepare leaders and employees for this shift. As in previous years, it draws on a large global survey, Microsoft 365 telemetry and LinkedIn hiring and labor trends. New this year are insights from AI-native startups, economists, scientists and academics — all pointing to a seismic shift already underway. In fact, 82% of leaders say this is a pivotal year to rethink core aspects of strategy and operations.

The data reveals the emergence of a new kind of organization: the Frontier Firm — built around intelligence on tap, human-agent teams and a new role for everyone: agent boss. While the shift ahead is profound, human ambition, creativity and ingenuity will continue to create new economic value and opportunity. In fact, 71% of workers at these firms say their company is thriving, compared to just 37% globally.

You can buy intelligence on tap

Imagine if you knew, before the internet took off, just how much it would reshape business. That’s where we are with AI. Intelligence is no longer bound by headcount or expertise. It’s an essential durable good: abundant, affordable and scalable on-demand. As economic and shareholder pressures grow, this on-demand intelligence offers a new lever for growth — one that can close the growing gap between business demands and human capacity. While 53% of leaders say productivity must increase, 80% of the global workforce reports lacking the time or energy to do their job. And on average, employees are interrupted by a meeting, email or ping every 2 minutes. To bridge this Capacity Gap, 82% of leaders expect to use digital labor to expand their workforce in the next 12 to 18 months.

Digital labor will spur the reinvention of even the most established firms — and the birth of new companies we haven’t even thought of yet. On LinkedIn, top AI startups are hiring at 2X the rate of Big Tech. Much of that talent is flowing out of Big Tech and staying in the startup world, pointing to a deeper shift where innovation — and opportunity — are rising. As incumbents adapt and challengers scale, like we saw in the .com boom, the rules of talent and competition are being rewritten in real time.

Human-agent teams will upend the org chart

As AI continues to democratize expertise, we’re seeing a move from rigid org charts to more fluid, outcome-driven Work Charts. These structures flex with the needs of the business, drawing on the right mix of humans and agents to get the job done. While every function will evolve at a different pace and scale, 46% of leaders say their organization is using agents to fully automate workstreams or business processes — with customer service, marketing and product development as the top AI investment priorities.

To maximize the impact of these human-agent teams, organizations need a new metric: the human-agent ratio. Leaders must ask two critical questions: How many agents are needed for which roles and tasks? And how many humans are needed to guide them? Getting that ratio right will be critical — and task-specific. Organizations will need to consider if there are times when human and digital labor outperform AI alone, when customers prefer a human touch or when society expects people to be responsible for the consequences — like a high-stakes product or finance decision. Whether it’s a customer conversation, a strategic decision or a product launch, knowing how to staff the right mix of humans and agents will define how work gets done — and how success is measured.

Every employee becomes an agent boss

As agents increasingly join the workforce, we’ll see the rise of the agent boss: someone who builds, delegates to and manages agents to amplify their impact and take control of their career in the age of AI. From the boardroom to the frontline, every worker will need to think like the CEO of an agent-powered startup. In fact, leaders expect their teams will be training (41%) and managing (36%) agents within five years.

For those ready to lean in, AI will be a career accelerator — but leaders are ahead. We measured the agent boss mindset across seven indicators — from regular use and trust to career impact. Leaders outpace employees on every measure: 67% are familiar with agents (vs. 40% of employees) and 79% believe AI will accelerate their careers (vs. 67%). But this shift won’t stop at the top. As agents become embedded into daily work, roles across every level and function will evolve — along with the broader workforce. While 33% of leaders are considering headcount reductions, 78% are considering hiring for new AI roles. And 83% say AI will enable employees to take on more complex and strategic work earlier in their careers.

This shift is multifaceted — every industry and role will evolve differently as the technology diffuses across business and society. Just as the internet era created billions of new knowledge jobs — from social media managers to UX designers — the AI era is already giving rise to new roles, with many more to come. Preparing for what’s next is no longer optional. Employees must build AI skills and companies must support them with the right tools and training. This moment calls for honest conversations, intentional communication and real investment in reskilling. The companies that invest now won’t just keep up — they’ll shape what comes next.

Copilot is the new UI for AI

Today we’re announcing the Microsoft 365 Copilot Wave 2 Spring release — designed to power the next era of human–agent collaboration. The Microsoft 365 Copilot app is now your window into the world of agents, with new capabilities for this next phase — driven by more advanced models, adaptive memory and reasoning agents that work alongside you. Updates include:

Researcher and Analyst agents powered by OpenAI’s deep reasoning models rolling out to customers through the Frontier program — and with our new Agent Store, you can easily find, pin and use agents — from partners like Jira, Monday.com and Miro — or your own custom agents.
Create brings OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI image generator to work, unlocking design and content creation skills for everyone. Easily modify or customize brand images or generate AI images aligned to your company’s approved brand guidelines and create everything from marketing copy and social assets to newsletter banners, videos and more.
Copilot Notebooks transforms your notes, documents and data into immediate insights and actions. By grounding Copilot in a notebook containing specific chats, files, meeting recordings and more, it can focus on the most relevant information — all while constantly scanning your source material to update in real time as your data evolves. Notebooks can even create an audio overview of your content with two hosts that walk you through the key points — a fun, flexible way to stay informed.
Copilot Search is a new AI-powered enterprise search that helps you find what you need instantly with rich, context-aware answers from across your organization’s apps and data. It connects to first- and third-party apps — from ServiceNow to Google Drive, Slack, Confluence, Jira and more — so you get fast, relevant results at work no matter where your data lives.
New capabilities in the Copilot Control System empower IT pros to enable, disable or block agents for specific users or groups — to help ensure the right agents are being used by the right people.

2025 will be remembered as the year the Frontier Firm was born — the moment companies moved beyond experimenting with AI and began rebuilding around it. Like the digital native companies of a generation ago, they understand the power of pairing irreplaceable human insight with AI and agents to unlock outsized value. We’re giving customers the insight to anticipate what’s next — and the technology to help shape it.

Celebrating Microsoft’s 50 years,"
		Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, shared the following remarks at Microsoft’s 50th anniversary today.
It’s so wonderful to be here with all of you celebrating 50 years of Microsoft. And it’s especially exciting to be doing it at a time like this. For me, though, it starts with Bill [Gates] and Steve [Ballmer], who are both here with us today. I want to say a very big thank you to the two of you, and to Paul [Allen], and what you’ve meant to me personally and your vision that you had building this extraordinary company of ours that I’ve had the privilege to be part of. Thank you for your vision, your leadership, your passion, and for building the Microsoft that we know today. A company that has truly changed the world.
Fifty years ago, Bill and Paul started Microsoft with a simple but powerful idea: to build technology so people everywhere could build more technology. The very first product Microsoft built was the Basic interpreter for the Altair, giving people the power to create software, jumpstarting the PC revolution, and creating an entirely new sector for our economy.

But today, it’s not just about the past 50 years, it’s about the next 50. If there’s one thing that I have learned during my time at Microsoft, it’s not about longevity, but relevance. Our future will not be defined by what we have built, but what we empower others to build.
This is why we are leading this new wave of AI innovation and more importantly, democratizing it, just like we did with the PC. From there we’ve gone to chat, to multi file edits, and now to agents. More than 150 million developers in nearly every country around the world are using GitHub.
So, I thought to myself, what if I could take that power and rebuild Microsoft’s very first product? And so, I tried it.

You really know you’re on to something. Intelligence has been commoditized when CEOs can start vibe coding. But in all seriousness, this is not just a cool party trick, It’s transformational. It’s empowering. It’s unleashing human ambition. And it’s happening now.
In fact, I’m excited to share that the capability I just showed with Agent Mode is rolling out to all Visual Studio Code users starting today. We now have autonomous AI agents or peer programmers who can collaborate with us to anticipate our needs and help us think more creatively, and it does not stop there. We are bringing full MCP support to Agent Mode; we’re also launching Code Review Agent today to fix and find bugs automatically; we’re also making it easier than ever before for developers to build their own agents in Azure AI Foundry.
Think of it like an agent factory. It’s a production line for intelligence. Tens and thousands of organizations are using Foundry to build their own agents. And today, we’re going further. We now have a new agent framework for building multi-agent systems. But building agents is just the very beginning. We’re also building tools for all the evals, fine tuning, observability, and feedback. And you’ll also have a red teaming agent and tools to measure code vulnerabilities. All of this in support of building trustworthy AI systems. There’s much, much more to come.
What started out as a developer tools company 50 years ago is now a platform company where everyone can be a developer. Our mission has not changed, it’s only expanded.
Just as we have done always, we are putting the power in people’s hands so that they can build software that moves their communities, their countries forward. The same ethos is driving Copilot, not just for developers, but for every aspect of working life. Helping people do things that allow them to do more things, whether it’s building apps, doing homework, shopping, planning, and so much more.
Ultimately, it all comes down to our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. I’ve always thought of Microsoft as a platform and partner-first company, and this has only been possible because of our customers, our partners and developers, and our 1.6 million employees, past and present, who have connected their passion with our purpose to get us where we are today. And it’s you who will continue to build this company to have impact around the world well into the future.
So, from the bottom of my heart, a big thank you to everyone who has contributed to Microsoft in getting us to this moment. I can’t wait to see what is next with Copilot and everything that we have for you.
Remarks have been edited for clarity.

Your AI Companion,"
		As I look back on the incredible impact that Microsoft has had over its now 50 years of relentless innovation, I’m inspired by the simplicity and power of Bill Gates’ bold ambition all those years ago: to put a PC on every desk and in every home. At Microsoft AI we’re driven by that same spirit. Today, we’re creating Copilot, an AI companion for everyone.
What does this mean? What does it look like? What does it do? Truth is, there’s no single answer that captures it. Because it’s going to look and feel a little different for each of us.
An AI companion is completely personal, built around individual needs, values and expectations. That’s why ultimately, there will be as many different Copilots as there are people using them. Today, we are embarking on the journey to take Copilot from an AI companion to your AI companion.
With your permission, Copilot will now remember what you talk about, so it learns your likes and dislikes and details about your life: the name of your dog, that tricky project at work, what keeps you motivated to stick to your new workout routine.
Copilot will understand you in the context of your life, and show up, on your terms, in the right way at the right time. This is far richer, more dynamic, supportive and emergent than any software we’ve seen before. It’s a new kind of relationship with technology, a new era.
Of course, we’re also focusing on the fundamentals: engaging personality, incredible search capability, custom-made answer cards, bespoke podcasts. With Deep Research you have a world-class researcher working alongside you. With Shopping, a trusted, impartial partner, looking out for the best products and deals. With Actions, let Copilot shoulder some of the burden, from scoring the gig tickets to sorting the ride home. Our new Windows app means your computer finally works on your behalf. And now with Copilot Vision on Mobile, Copilot can see what you see, responding in real time to create a shared understanding of your world.
But the important point is that throughout Copilot is more than an AI, it’s yours. It remembers not just what you said, but who you are. Copilot helps you stay organized, think clearly, learn more intuitively. It’s there when you need a quick factual answer, a long exploratory debate or when you fancy just downloading after a hard day.
Every day we hear the most incredible stories about the many and varied ways people enjoy Copilot. So, as we continue on our journey to create a Copilot for everyone, we’re focusing on one critical goal: to make it truly yours. Each will have its own unique style and blend of attributes that distinctly suit each and every one of us. All the while, we’ll stick to our core promise. You remain in control, you are the pilot and you make the calls and set the boundaries.
We can’t wait for you to discover your personal Copilot.

Mustafa Suleyman, Executive Vice President and CEO of Microsoft AI

Memory and Personalization
Memory is essential for creating a true AI companion. With Memory, Copilot can remember important details: your favorite food, the types of films you enjoy and your nephew’s birthday and his interests. As you interact with Copilot, it notes your preferences, building a richer user profile and offering tailored solutions, proactive suggestions and timely reminders. Copilot prioritizes security and privacy, giving you control through the user dashboard and the option to choose which types of information it remembers about you or to opt out entirely. You remain in control.

As we explore the full range of what true personalization means, we are experimenting with new ways for you to interact with your Copilot. For example, what if your Copilot had an appearance and you could shape and form it to be whatever you want? We’re early in this thinking but soon you’ll have the ability to personalize Copilot and interact with your AI companion in a fun way while it offers advice and support when you want it. You can strike up a conversation with Copilot and now have an entertaining appearance that’s unique to you.

Actions 
Another key advancement that makes Copilot a helpful AI companion is its ability to now take action on your behalf. With Actions, Copilot can now partner with you to complete tasks behind the scenes. Use simple chat prompts to ask Copilot to book event tickets, grab dinner reservations or send a thoughtful gift to a friend and it will check that task off your list. Copilot Actions will work with most websites across the web, and we’re particularly excited to highlight our launch partners: 1-800-Flowers.com, Booking.com, Expedia, Kayak, OpenTable, Priceline, Tripadvisor, Skyscanner, Viator and Vrbo.

 Copilot Vision
We introduced Vision in Copilot for the web late last year and now we’re bringing it to mobile and Windows.

Copilot and your phone’s camera now enable an interactive experience with the real world, in real time. From the Copilot app on your phone, you can look around at your surroundings and request information, guidance or ideas. It can analyze both real-time video from the camera and photos stored on your camera roll. For example, use Vision to improve plant health by asking it to examine your plants and suggest actions, or to scan your office and provide tips on decoration. Vision on Mobile is available today in the Copilot app for iOS and Android.
The new native Windows app will allow you to call upon Copilot while working across multiple applications, browser tabs or files. It will read the screen and interact with the content. You’ll be able to use Copilot to search, change settings, organize files and collaborate on projects without switching between files or apps. The Copilot app can be accessed by hitting Alt+Space or holding Alt+Space for two seconds to use voice commands. The native Copilot app for Windows is available today. Vision will be available first for Windows Insiders starting next week and will be rolled out more broadly afterwards.


 Pages
Copilot now provides a way to organize your thoughts and content from chaos to calm. It takes all your scattered notes, content, research — whatever it is — and puts it in a canvas that Copilot organizes, simplifies and helps you with from your first rough draft to your very final edits. Pages lets you refine, iterate and keep the conversation going whenever you need it.

YouTube Video

 Podcasts
Copilot can now generate AI-powered podcasts that curate and deliver personalized audio content based on your interests. Podcasts give you an easy, engaging and different way to consume information with minimal effort. Copilot can create a personalized podcast to analyze and compare options like with a vacation plan or home purchase or you can provide content to Copilot like a study or specific web sites and Copilot will generate a podcast that helps explain the topic. While listening, you can continue to talk and interact with Copilot to learn more and keep the conversations going. It’s a daily audio solution that helps you solve tough problems, explore a new hobby or just enjoy an easy to digest solution to all that endless scrolling.

 Shopping
Copilot is now your personal shopper: on your side, doing the research, building comparisons, offering advice. It lets you know about price drops and sales and will let you purchase directly from the app. Shopping with Copilot is the easy solution to find the products and services you love.

YouTube Video

 Deep Research
Deep Research is a new feature for Copilot that lets you conduct complex, multi-step research tasks more efficiently — shaving hours off the time it would normally take to complete. Copilot can find, analyze and combine information from online sources or large amounts of documents and images.

Copilot Search
Copilot Search in Bing transforms web search by bringing traditional and generative search together. It cross-checks information across multiple sites to deliver detailed, comprehensive responses directly in Bing, complete with helpful cited sources and suggestions for further exploration. You can learn more about Copilot Search here.

We’re beginning to roll out the initial versions of these new experiences starting today. We will continue to expand availability in the coming weeks and months, which will vary by platform, market and language as we work through the rollout process. We will continue to listen to feedback from customers, adjusting and refining these experiences over time.
If you haven’t tried Copilot yet, download the app for free today at the Microsoft Store or at app stores for iOS, Mac or Android, experience the best AI companion for Windows on a Copilot+ PC or use Copilot on the web at copilot.microsoft.com. Thank you for being on this journey with us and here’s to the next 50 years of Microsoft.

Microsoft at 50: The journey and future of the partner ecosystem,"As we celebrate Microsoft’s 50th anniversary, our annual State of the Partner Ecosystem moment is a great opportunity to reflect on the incredible journey we’ve shared with our partners, employees and customers. Together, we’ve harnessed technology as a force for good, transforming industries and communities. From our early days of revolutionizing personal computing to leading the way in cloud innovation and now AI, our shared milestones highlight the power of collaboration and reinvention.

Fifty years ago, Microsoft started with a bold idea: the belief that technology could change the world. Thanks to the largest partner ecosystem in the industry, numbering 500,000 and growing, that vision became a reality, and I know we are just getting started. From the early days of distributing Windows PCs and Office to now delivering AI transformation strategies that solve the most complex customer challenges, our ability to stay at the forefront of innovation as technology evolves is a testament to our culture of continuous reinvention.

According to IDC, for every $1 of Microsoft revenue, services partners earn $8.45, and software partners earn $10.93. This underscores the immense opportunity available to partners of all types. As we look ahead to the future, we know that generative AI (GenAI) is forecast to grow exponentially faster than the overall IT market. Partners generating at least 25% of their Microsoft-related revenue from AI can expect higher margins and revenue growth, unlocking even more potential for transformation and success.*

Microsoft has always been a partner-led company. Our partners are core to our heritage and our future. Their innovation and collaboration have driven real transformation and customer success and will continue to shape the future of industries around the world. As we commemorate this historic moment, I want to take the opportunity to say Thank You to our partners for being on this incredible journey with us.

Here are just a few ways you can join us to celebrate this milestone:

Watch this video from Judson Althoff, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Microsoft.
Join the Microsoft AI Skills Fest for 50 days of learning and discovery starting April 8! Gain skills that will empower you and your team to build innovative AI solutions with Microsoft’s apps and services.

We are also expanding access to Azure Migrate and Modernize and Azure Innovate incentives for SMB pathways. Read more about the SMB path to Azure Solutions Partner designations.

Cloud Solution Provider is our partner hero motion for small and medium enterprises

In November at Microsoft Ignite, we highlighted the $661 billion total addressable market (TAM) opportunity for SME&C in FY25 and beyond. Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners are the trusted advisors who serve these customers and accelerate their AI transformation with the value-added services and solutions that create real business impact. CSP is our hero motion that enables those partners to drive this business transformation.

“Our Microsoft partnership has evolved to meet the needs of our business and our partners. Together we’ve been able to support our partners to deliver true solution and value selling, leveraging the robust resources available through Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program and benefitting from the rich incentives. It has enabled us to drive innovation and deliver exceptional experiences for our partners through our ArrowSphere platform and broader enablement programs to ensure they’re empowered to deliver real customer outcomes. Together, we’re enabling the channel to deliver solutions that deliver real impact for customers around the world.”

— Brendan Murphy, Global Director, Public Cloud, Arrow Electronics

We strive to provide CSP partners with the skilling, capabilities and investments to make this opportunity a reality. So far in FY25, we have:

focused our incentives to clearly align to our five strategic priorities — Copilot on every device across every role, AI design wins with every customer, securing the cyber foundation of every customer, a focus on migrations and Microsoft 365 execution
dedicated 70% of our total incentive spend to partners that serve the Small, Medium Enterprises and Channel (SME&C) segment
introduced a series of new promos, including a new-to-Microsoft 365 E5 offer to enable CSP partners to win new customers

Expanding our portfolio of CSP offers and capabilities is an ongoing priority. We share updates as they become available.

Capturing the marketplace opportunity

As customers increasingly centralize their solution procurement, marketplaces have become the preferred buying platform. For software companies, adopting cloud marketplaces accelerates deal closure and increases deal sizes. Serving as a global B2B commerce engine, our marketplace empowers Microsoft partners to provide solutions to customers worldwide. It offers various sales models: digital direct, through partners or with Microsoft — providing flexibility to align with how customers want to buy and how partners want to sell. Learn more in this recent blog.

Unlocking success through skilling and events

Microsoft Ability Summit 2025: Accessibility in the AI era,"
		Today, we hosted the 15th annual Microsoft Ability Summit, with over 20,000 attendees from 164 countries coming together virtually to discuss the future of AI and accessibility. Microsoft has a long-standing commitment to investing in accessibility, grounded in our business model and going back over three decades from the earliest accessibility features in Windows 95 and continuing today with new hardware and software functionalities powered by AI. We are innovating faster than ever before and people with disabilities continue to lead the way.
Accessibility is a fundamental right for people with disabilities and makes technology easier for everyone. We see this reflected in how customers are using Microsoft technologies around the world. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is unlocking workplace productivity like never before, more than 10 million people use Edge each month to have the web Read Aloud, over 1 million people use Immersive Reader to make webpages easier to read and partners like Tobii Dynavox and Special Olympics are bringing AI to people with disabilities globally. And these are just some of the highlights of what we shared today!
Here’s a quick summary of the new accessibility products, features and programs announced at the 2025 Ability Summit.
What’s new in 2025?
We announced that the Xbox Adaptive Joystick is now available for purchase exclusively at Microsoft Store. With more than 429 million players with disabilities worldwide, we know each player has unique needs and preferences for how they choose to play. The Xbox Adaptive Joystick is a singular, wired controller primarily designed to meet the needs of players with limited mobility. Its versatility helps players seamlessly incorporate it into their existing gaming setups. Built with the Gaming and Disability community who inform the development of Xbox products from the beginning. The joystick joins our family of adaptive accessories including the mouse, pen, adaptive kit and Xbox Adaptive Controller. For more details visit Xbox Support.
And all our Microsoft hardware comes in packaging designed to be accessible and sustainable. No more plastic clamshells! To help others with accessible packaging, today at the Summit, the Packaging and Content Team at Microsoft published its Accessible Packaging Design Guide, which offers practical guidelines, best practices and strategies to create accessible packaging and foster a trusted customer experience.
At the Summit, Microsoft teams and partners also shared ways they are working to further advance accessibility through technology:

Tobii Dynavox is integrating Microsoft Neural Voice, a capability of Azure AI Speech, into their assistive communication solutions. This AI-powered feature gives more personal options for individuals who use assistive communication devices using eye gaze. Neural Voices are available in over 50 languages within their apps TD Talk and TD Phone.
Microsoft Teams will improve for those using Sign Language View. Later this year, Teams will be able to identify when someone is using sign language and feature them prominently as a speaker in the meeting. These video customizations are part of our ongoing product development to help deliver clear and accessible communication for everyone.
Copilot is powering neurodiverse talent. Recently, an EY study found that Copilot helped 76% of neurodiverse employees perform better at work by enhancing communication, memory recall and focus. At the Summit, we shared how new simple features like Team Reflow and PowerPoint Designer are helping people do their work. See four early adopters of Copilot in New York share their stories.

Special Olympics shared how Copilot has been a game-changing training companion for their coaches and athletes with intellectual and development disabilities for the Special Olympics World Winter Games in Turin, Italy.

All this progress is possible because of the people who design technology with accessibility in mind. In this way, technology benefits everyone, creating a more productive and efficient workplace. It is beautiful to see that reflected in this profile of Dave Dame, Senior Director of Accessibility and Human Factors at Microsoft, where he shared how accessible technology helps him thrive as a leader.
Onward
For over 30 years, Microsoft has focused on accessibility in our products. Accessibility makes our tools and technologies easier for everyone and accelerates innovation for the world. From the introduction of Sticky Keys and speech recognition in Windows 95 to Seeing AI in 2016 and beyond, accessibility innovations have benefited people in ways we designed for and ways we could have never expected. Just think about how closed captions are now invaluable for everyone watching videos and calls.
AI has the potential to create significant advancements across every sector of our economy and society. We will continue to be grounded and responsible in our approach as we work to get the latest technology to the people who can benefit from it the most.
Whether this is your first or fifteenth Ability Summit, thank you for joining and we hope you picked up a new feature, skill or nugget that helps you, your community or your organization get the most out of technology. All content will be available to watch after the event.
Let’s move forward together.

A new level unlocked,"Today Microsoft released Muse, a first-of-its-kind generative AI model that we are applying to gaming. But it’s so much more than that. What we’re sharing today is a huge step forward for gameplay ideation. And what’s even more exciting is what this breakthrough represents in our journey of building and using generative AI, and what industries, developers and creators of all interests will be enabled to do next.

The impressive abilities we first witnessed with ChatGPT and GPT-4 to learn human language are now being matched by AI’s abilities to learn the mechanics of how things work, in effect developing a practical understanding of interactions in the world. As a computer scientist, this ability to understand and model a 3D world is something I and many other great researchers have pursued for over 10 years and, personally, I was not sure that it could be made possible with such speed and quality.

In the case of Muse, just from observing human gameplay, this model develops a deep understanding of the environment, including its dynamics and how it evolves over time in response to actions. This unlocks the ability to rapidly iterate, remix and create in video games so developers can eventually create immersive environments and unleash their full creativity.

Beyond gaming, I’m excited by the potential of this capability to enable AI assistants that understand and help visualize things, from reconfiguring the kitchen in your home to redesigning a retail space to building a digital twin of a factory floor to test and explore different scenarios. All these things are just now becoming possible with AI. From the perspective of computer science research, it’s pretty amazing, and the future applications of this are likely to be transformative for creators.

Introducing CoreAI – Platform and Tools,"Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, shared the below communication with Microsoft employees this morning.

As we begin the new year, it’s clear that we’re entering the next innings of this AI platform shift. 2025 will be about model-forward applications that reshape all application categories. More so than any previous platform shift, every layer of the application stack will be impacted. It’s akin to GUI, internet servers, and cloud-native databases all being introduced into the app stack simultaneously. Thirty years of change is being compressed into three years!

We will build agentic applications with memory, entitlements, and action space that will inherit powerful model capabilities. And we will adapt these capabilities for enhanced performance and safety across roles, business processes, and industry domains. Further, how we build, deploy, and maintain code for these AI applications is also fundamentally changing and becoming agentic.

This is leading to a new AI-first app stack — one with new UI/UX patterns, runtimes to build with agents, orchestrate multiple agents, and a reimagined management and observability layer. In this world, Azure must become the infrastructure for AI, while we build our AI platform and developer tools — spanning Azure AI Foundry, GitHub, and VS Code — on top of it. In other words, our AI platform and tools will come together to create agents, and these agents will come together to change every SaaS application category, and building custom applications will be driven by software (i.e. “service as software”).

The good news is that we have been working at this for more than two years and have learned a lot in terms of the systems, app platform, and tools required for the AI era. To more rapidly and boldly advance our roadmap across each of these layers, we are creating a new engineering organization: CoreAI – Platform and Tools.

This new division will bring together Dev Div, AI Platform, and some key teams from the Office of the CTO (AI Supercomputer, AI Agentic Runtimes, and Engineering Thrive), with the mission to build the end-to-end Copilot & AI stack for both our first-party and third-party customers to build and run AI apps and agents. This group will also build out GitHub Copilot, thus having a tight feedback loop between the leading AI-first product and the AI platform to motivate the stack and its roadmap.

Jay Parikh will lead this group as EVP of CoreAI – Platform and Tools, with Eric Boyd, Jason Taylor, Julia Liuson, Tim Bozarth, and their respective teams reporting to Jay.

Jay will work closely with Scott, Rajesh, Charlie, Mustafa, and Kevin to optimize our entire tech stack for both performance and efficiency. Additionally, Jay and team will lead our progress and work around developer productivity and Engineering Thrive across the company.

As our cloud infrastructure business continues to grow and scale to become Microsoft’s largest business, Scott will continue to lead Cloud + AI to ensure we’re delivering the quality, security, and innovation that our customers and partners count on for their most mission-critical applications, databases, and AI workloads.

Ultimately, we must remember that our internal organizational boundaries are meaningless to both our customers and to our competitors. When we talk about operating as One Microsoft, we are effectively talking about how we are continually increasing our customer focus, raising the bar on our innovation, and driving accountability, so we can truly live up to our mission.

Our success in this next phase will be determined by having the best AI platform, tools, and infrastructure. We have a lot of work to do and a tremendous opportunity ahead, and together, I’m looking forward to building what comes next.

Anyone can easily set up Actions right in their Microsoft 365 app, allowing users to focus on more impactful work, save time and boost productivity.

New agents in Microsoft 365 are designed to help scale individual impact and transform business process. At Ignite we will introduce:

Agents in SharePoint: These natural language AI assistants are grounded on relevant SharePoint sites, files and folders to make it easy to find answers from that content, and to make quicker decisions as a result. Now generally available, every SharePoint site will include an agent tailored to its content. Users can also create customized agents scoped to select SharePoint files, folders or sites with as little as one click.
Interpreter: This agent in Teams helps users overcome language barriers by enabling real-time, speech-to-speech interpretation in meetings. Available in public preview in early 2025, meeting participants will also have the option to have the agent simulate their personal voice.
The Employee Self-Service Agent: An agent available in private preview in Business Chat expedites answers for the most common policy-related questions and simplifies action-taking on key HR and IT-related tasks — like helping employees understand their benefits or request a new laptop. It can be customized in Copilot Studio to meet an organization’s unique needs.
Other agents in public preview take real-time meeting notes in Teams and automate project management from start to finish in Planner.
Copilot + AI Stack

The Copilot stack empowers users to build more ambitious products by leveraging advanced technology at each layer of the stack. To create a unified experience where customers can design, customize and manage AI applications and agents, we are introducing Azure AI Foundry, which gives customers access to all existing Azure AI services and tooling, plus new capabilities like:

Azure AI Foundry SDK, now available in preview, provides a unified toolchain for designing, customizing and managing AI apps and agents with enterprise-grade control and customization. With tools that help organizations responsibly scale their applications, Foundry also provides 25 prebuilt app templates and a simplified coding experience they can access from familiar tools like GitHub, Visual Studio and Copilot Studio.
Azure AI Foundry portal (formerly Azure AI Studio), now available in preview, is a comprehensive visual user interface to help developers discover AI models, services and tools. With a new management center experience that brings essential subscription information into a single dashboard, the portal also helps IT admins, operations and compliance teams manage AI applications at scale.
Azure AI Agent Service, coming soon to preview, will enable professional developers to orchestrate, deploy and scale enterprise-ready agents to automate business processes.

We also continue to back up our Trustworthy AI commitments with new tools. Today we’re announcing AI reports and risk and safety evaluations for images to help organizations ensure AI applications are safe and compliant. AI reports will help organizations improve observability, collaboration and governance for AI apps and fine-tuned models, while evaluations for image content will help customers assess the frequency and severity of harmful content in their app’s AI-generated outputs.

Copilot+ devices

As organizations move more workloads to the cloud to enhance security and flexibility, Microsoft is expanding its Cloud PC solution by introducing the first in a new class of devices purpose-built to connect securely to Windows 365 in seconds.

Windows 365 Link is the simple, secure, purpose-built device for Windows 365. It is in preview now and will become generally available for purchase starting in April 2025 in select markets with an MSRP of $349, allowing users to work securely in a familiar Windows desktop in the Microsoft Cloud with responsive, high-fidelity experiences.

Windows 365 Link is secure by design. The device has no local data, no local apps and admin-less users so corporate data stays protected within the Microsoft Cloud.

Other new capabilities for Copilot+ PCs for commercial customers include harnessing the power of inbuilt native processing units (NPUs) to deliver local AI. With improved Windows Search, and the new Recall experience (preview), finding what you need on your PC is easier than ever by just describing what you are looking for. These features are releasing first to our Windows Insider community on Copilot+ PCs before rolling out more broadly to our customers.

BlackRock momentum

Four years ago, BlackRock, one of the world’s pre-eminent asset management firms, formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft to move its Aladdin platform to Microsoft Azure. With this foundation on Azure, BlackRock rolled out generative AI tools for global clients with Aladdin Copilot. Through generative AI, Aladdin Copilot serves to strengthen the connective tissue across the platform, leveraging Microsoft technology to help users receive answers instantly to unlock new efficiencies and discover important business insights even faster. Aladdin Copilot makes BlackRock’s Aladdin platform even more intelligent and responsive. That results in enhanced productivity, enables scale and keeps users more informed.

BlackRock’s move to Azure and launch of Aladdin Copilot are just two of the many ongoing milestones in a long-term partnership that also includes an enterprise-wide deal for 24,000 seats of Microsoft 365 Copilot. Today, about 60% of BlackRock’s Copilot user population is leveraging Copilot on a weekly basis. Additionally, BlackRock also recently made the choice to move its on-prem CRM solution to the cloud with Dynamics 365, citing its native integration with Teams and Outlook as one of its primary decision-making factors.

Strength in security

We know that the threat landscape is rapidly evolving, and it’s imperative that we stay ahead of bad actors. At Microsoft we believe that security is a team sport, and we are stronger when we partner as a security community to share information, collaborate and stop bad actors.

In that spirit, and as part of our Secure Future Initiative (SFI), at Ignite we are announcing the largest public security research event in history: the Zero Day Quest. This event, which focuses on AI and cloud security, will offer the largest award pool in the industry at $4 million, in addition to our existing $16 million annual bounty program. This competition aims to attract the world’s best security minds to tackle high-impact scenarios critical to our customers’ security, with award multipliers, starting today.

As the threat landscape has changed, we have seen rapid evolution in the way attackers exploit weaknesses within systems — particularly by navigating graph relationships between identities, files and devices to uncover attack paths. Attackers thinking in graphs cause wider damage from the first point of intrusion. Traditional security products, with limited visibility into these graph relationships, are often better suited to protect specific devices or mediums — like laptops or inboxes — rather than the full scope of potential attack surface.

Today’s Microsoft Security Exposure Management launch is a pivotal step in transforming cybersecurity with savvy data and AI-based strategies. The power of incorporating Microsoft graph data, in context with data from customers’ other third-party security tools, creates a powerful single pane of glass to visualize attack paths before threat actors do. With computing power and cloud-scale performance to distill powerful real-time mapping of assets and evolving risks, Exposure Management assists security teams in preventing intrusions and provides IT, operations and risk leaders with real-time data to support cyber risk decision-making.

This is only a small section of the many exciting features and updates we will be announcing at Ignite. As a reminder, you can view keynote sessions from Microsoft executives including Satya Nadella, Rajesh Jha, Scott Guthrie, Charlie Bell and Vasu Jakkal, live or on-demand.

Plus, you can get more on all these announcements by exploring the Book of News, the official compendium of all today’s news.

From questions to discoveries: NASA’s new Earth Copilot brings Microsoft AI capabilities to democratize access to complex data,"
		Every day, NASA’s satellites orbit Earth, capturing a wealth of information that helps us understand our planet. From monitoring wildfires to tracking climate change, this vast trove of Earth Science data has the potential to drive scientific discoveries, inform policy decisions and support industries like agriculture, urban planning and disaster response.
But navigating the over 100 petabytes of collected data can be challenging, which is why NASA has collaborated with Microsoft to explore the use of a custom copilot using Azure OpenAI Service to develop NASA’s Earth Copilot, which could transform how people interact with Earth’s data.
Geospatial data is complex, and often requires some level of technical expertise to navigate it. As a result, this data tends to be accessible only to a limited number of researchers and scientists. As NASA collects more data from new satellites, these complexities only grow and may further limit the potential pool of people able to draw insights and develop applications that could benefit society.
Recognizing this challenge, NASA embarked on a mission to make its data more accessible and user-friendly.  Through NASA’s Office of the Chief Science Data Officer, the agency seeks to democratize data access, breaking down technical barriers to empower a diverse range of audiences, from scientists and educators to policymakers and the general public.

The challenge: Navigating the complexity of data
NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems Program is responsible for collecting an incredible variety of data from spaceborne sensors and instruments. This data spans everything from atmospheric conditions to land cover changes, ocean temperatures and more. However, the sheer scale and complexity of this information can be overwhelming. For many, finding and extracting insights requires navigating technical interfaces, understanding data formats and mastering the intricacies of geospatial analysis — specialized skills that very few non-technical users possess. AI could streamline this process, reducing time to gain insights from Earth’s data to a matter of seconds.
This issue isn’t just a matter of convenience; it has real-world implications. For example, scientists who need to analyze historical data on hurricanes to improve predictive models, or policymakers who want to study deforestation patterns to implement environmental regulations, may find themselves unable to easily access the data they need. This inaccessibility affects a broad array of sectors, including agriculture, urban planning and disaster response, where timely insights from spaceborne data could make a significant difference.
Moreover, as new satellites with new instruments continue to launch and collect more data, NASA is constantly faced with the challenge of building new tools to manage and make sense of this growing repository. The agency explored emerging technologies that could not only streamline data discovery but also broaden accessibility, enabling more people to engage with the data and uncover new insights.
The solution: AI-powered data access through Microsoft Azure
To address these challenges, NASA IMPACT worked with Microsoft to develop an AI-driven customer copilot, called Earth Copilot, which could simplify data access and encourage a wider range of users to interact with its Earth Science data. Together, they built the proof of concept AI model that leverages Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform and advanced AI capabilities to transform how users can search, discover and analyze NASA’s geospatial data.
The key to NASA’s Earth Copilot lies in the integration of cloud-based technologies like Azure OpenAI Service, which provides access to powerful AI models and natural language processing capabilities that enable developers to integrate intelligent, conversational AI into their applications. This approach allows NASA to integrate AI into its existing data analysis platform — VEDA. These technologies together make it easier for users to search, discover and analyze Earth Science data
By combining these technologies, Earth Copilot enables users to interact with NASA’s data repository through plain language queries. Instead, they can simply ask questions such as “What was the impact of Hurricane Ian in Sanibel Island?” or “How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect air quality in the US?” AI will then retrieve relevant datasets, making the process seamless and intuitive.
NASA’s EARTHDATA VEDA Dashboard.
“Azure’s robust suite of services, including machine learning, data analytics and scalable cloud infrastructure, powers this AI prototype,” said Juan Carlos López, former NASA engineer and current Azure Specialist at Microsoft. “We’ve designed the system to handle complex queries and large datasets efficiently, ensuring that users can quickly find the information they need without getting bogged down by technical complexities. Our goal was to create a seamless, scalable solution that could evolve as NASA’s data, tools and applications grow.”
Democratizing data for open science
The collaboration between NASA IMPACT and Microsoft has resulted in a solution that democratizes access to spaceborne data, enabling a broader range of users to engage with NASA’s science data. This has significant benefits for the scientific community, as researchers can now spend less time on data retrieval and more on analysis and discovery. For example, climate scientists can quickly access historical data to study trends, while agricultural experts can gain insights into soil moisture levels to improve crop management.
Educators and teachers can use real-world examples to engage students in Earth Science, fostering curiosity and encouraging the next generation of scientists and engineers. Policymakers can leverage the data to make informed decisions on critical issues like climate change, urban development and disaster preparedness, ensuring they have the most accurate information at their fingertips.
“The vision behind this collaboration was to leverage AI and cloud technologies to bring Earth’s insights to communities that have been underserved, where access to data can lead to tangible improvements,” said Minh Nguyen, Cloud Solution Architect at Microsoft. “By enabling users to interact with the data through simple, plain language queries, we’re helping to democratize access to spaceborne information.”
The development of this AI prototype aligns with NASA’s Open Science initiative, which aims to make scientific research more transparent, inclusive and collaborative. By removing barriers to data discovery, NASA and Microsoft are setting the stage for a new era of discovery, where insights are not confined to a select few but can be explored and expanded by anyone curious about the world.
Looking ahead: Bridging the gap between data and insights
At the moment, the NASA Earth Copilot is available to NASA scientists and researchers to explore and test its capabilities. Any responsible deployment of AI technologies requires rigorous assessments to ensure the data and outputs cannot be misused. After a period of internal evaluations and testing, the NASA IMPACT team will explore the integration of this capability into the VEDA platform.
This collaboration exemplifies how technology can empower people, drive innovation and create positive change. Solutions like this will be essential in ensuring the benefits of data are shared widely, enabling more people to engage with, analyze and act upon information that shapes our world.

How Copilots are helping customers and partners drive pragmatic innovation to achieve business results that matter,"The pace of AI innovation today continues to be extraordinary, and at Microsoft we are focused on helping organizations embrace it. By providing our customers with the most advanced AI technology across every product we build — combined with our unparalleled partner ecosystem and co-innovation approach — we are helping them make real progress in ways that matter. I am proud to share over 100 customer stories from this quarter alone showing how we are helping customers accelerate AI Transformation — no matter where they are on their journey.

Recently during the Microsoft AI Tour, I spoke with customers who shared ways they are adopting Copilots to empower human achievement, democratize intelligence and realize significant business value. I also discussed the concept of an AI-first business process and the differentiation you can drive when bringing together the power of Copilots and human ambition with the autonomous capabilities of an agent. I was inspired by the outcomes our customers have achieved through pragmatic innovation and the progress they are making to evolve the future of industry. I am pleased to share ten stories from the past quarter that illustrate how Copilots have yielded results for our customers, while highlighting AI Transformation experiences in their own words.

Accenture and Avanade have a long history of helping customers implement cutting-edge solutions, with internal testing a key factor in their ability to deliver customizable Microsoft solutions with deep expertise. Putting Microsoft 365 Copilot into the hands of employees helped them realize ways to increase productivity, with 52% of employees seeing a positive impact on the quality of their work, 31% reporting less cognitive fatigue and 84% finding Copilot’s suggestions fair, respectful and non-biased. Accenture also piloted GitHub Copilot to help build better solutions faster with developers spending less time debugging, resulting in 95% of developers reporting they enjoyed coding more.

“Using our extensive Microsoft technology expertise and practical learnings from our own experience implementing Microsoft 365 Copilot, our solutions empower clients to fully tap into Microsoft AI capabilities.”

Veit Siegenheim, Global Future of Work Lead at Avanade

Nigerian multinational financial services group Access Holdings Plc. serves more than 56 million customers across 18 countries. As the business grew and transitioned from a small bank to a major holding company, it adopted Microsoft 365 Copilot to address challenges in data management, meeting productivity and software development. With the integration of Copilot into daily tools, the company significantly enhanced efficiency and engagement across the business. Writing code now takes two hours instead of eight, chatbots can be launched in 10 days instead of three months and presentations can be prepared in 45 minutes instead of six hours. Copilot has also driven a 25% increase in staff engagement during meetings.

“To inspire everyone in the organization to take advantage of AI, we knew we had to integrate AI into the tools people use every day. Microsoft 365 Copilot made the most sense and was a natural fit for us.”

Lanre Bamisebi, Executive Director IT and Digitalization at Access Holdings, Plc.

To improve resident services and reinvent customer engagement, the City of Burlington, Ontario, embraced AI and low-code tools to develop new online services that transform and automate internal processes. In just eight weeks, the city utilized Copilot Studio to develop and launch a custom copilot designed to help residents quickly find answers to frequently asked questions. The city also developed a portal that streamlines building permit reviews and enables customers to track the status of their own applications. As a result, the average time it takes to process a permit approval decreased from 15 weeks to 5-7 weeks, allowing more time for city employees to evaluate complex submissions.

“Our staff and citizens do not have to worry about mundane tasks as much anymore. Now they’re able to have rich, collaborative conversations about how to creatively solve problems, making for a much more fulfilling and rewarding work and customer experience.”

Chad MacDonald, Executive Director and Chief Information Officer at the City of Burlington

Finastra empowers financial institutions with leading software for lending, payments, treasury, capital markets and universal banking. To transform its marketing processes, the company used Microsoft 365 Copilot to automate tasks, enhance content creation, improve analytics and personalize customer interactions. Since integrating Copilot, the team reduced time-to-market for campaigns from three months to less than one. Copilot also significantly reduced the time marketers spend generating and gathering insights from each campaign, with employees citing a 20%-50% time savings across tasks like full-funnel analysis, supply management analysis and budget management.

“Copilot makes you more effective because you get better insights, and it makes you more efficient because you can produce results faster. It also makes work more meaningful and fun because your team can focus on what matters — strategy, creativity and everything that sets you apart from the competition.”

Joerg Klueckmann, Head of Corporate Marketing and Communications at Finastra

With 1,000 engineers already using GitHub Copilot, the tool allows them to innovate faster, reduce errors and focus more time on complex tasks to deliver greater value to their users.

“GitHub Copilot has significantly reduced syntax errors and provided helpful autocomplete features, eliminating repetitive tasks and making coding more efficient. This has allowed me to focus on the more complex elements in building great software.”

Nayana Hodi, Engineering Manager at GoTo Group

South Africa’s Milpark Education faced operational challenges when shifting to online learning due to legacy systems slowing down student interactions and support. Through close collaboration with Enterprisecloud, Milpark migrated its back-office infrastructure to Azure within three months, replacing its legacy student admissions system with an extensible, integrated digital platform powered by technologies such as Microsoft Copilot and Copilot Studio. In just four months, the educational institution improved efficiency and accuracy of student support, decreasing the average resolution time by 50% and escalations by more than 30%.

“Using Copilot, agents are now able to use generative AI to rapidly get up to speed on case details and respond to students using standardized templates that help them provide more personalized and professional responses. The results speak for themselves.”

Shaun Dale, Managing Director at Enterprisecloud

For over two decades, Teladoc Health has been offering a broad spectrum of services to patients using virtual care services — from primary care to chronic condition management. After the rapid growth of telehealth adoption post-pandemic, operational efficiency was instrumental in managing internal processes and external client interactions. By deploying Microsoft 365 Copilot and using Copilot in Power Automate, the company has reshaped business processes to help employees realize greater time savings while enhancing the client experience. The Copilots and agents helped employees save five hours per week and thousands of enterprise hours annually by eliminating mundane daily processes and fostering better cross-department communications, while also helping new employees get set up to run their workflows 20% faster.

“Copilot is changing the way we work. It’s not just about saving time; it’s about enhancing the quality of our work, allowing us to focus on what truly matters: delivering exceptional care to our members.” 

Heather Underhill, SVP Client Experience & Operations at Teladoc Health

International energy company Uniper adopted a single-cloud strategy with Azure as its foundation to drive rapid AI innovation. To help its employees focus on using core competencies, the company implemented Microsoft 365 Copilot to reduce time spent on manual and repetitive tasks, and help workers focus on more pressing work, such as developing enhanced solutions to speed up the energy transition. Its in-house auditors have already increased productivity by 80% by using Copilot to create plans and checklists. Uniper is also using Copilot for Security to help identify risks twice as fast and take appropriate action sooner.

“As an operator of critical infrastructure, we have to contend with a growing number of reports of phishing and attacks by hackers. AI can help us implement a sensible way of managing the sheer number of threats.”

Damian Bunyan, CIO at Uniper

British telecommunications company Vodafone has transformed its workplace productivity with Microsoft 365 Copilot, already seeing strong ROI from its adoption. In early trials, Copilot saved employees an average of three hours per week by using the tool to draft emails, summarize meetings and search for information. Copilot is also enriching the employee experience, with 90% of users reporting they are eager to continue using Copilot and 60% citing improved work quality. For Vodafone’s legal and compliance team, Copilot has significantly accelerated the processes of drafting new contracts, reducing the time required to complete this work by one hour. As a result of these efficiency gains, Vodafone is rolling out Copilot to 68,000 employees.

“Our AI journey is focusing on three areas: operational efficiency inside the organization; rewiring the business to provide an enhanced customer experience; and unlocking growth opportunities through new products and services that we can create around generative AI. Copilot will help drive all three.”

Scott Petty, Chief Technology Officer at Vodafone

Wallenius Wilhelmsen, a global leader in roll-on/roll-off shipping and vehicle logistics, is empowering better decision-making while fostering a culture of innovation and inclusion with AI tools. After participating in an early access program, the company broadly adopted Microsoft Copilot 365 to help streamline processes, enhance data management and improve communication across its 28 countries. To help strengthen Copilot immersion and realize value faster, they introduced a seven-week Microsoft Viva campaign to teach, communicate and measure Copilot adoption. The campaign resulted in 80% of employees using Copilot, with some teams realizing time savings of at least 30 minutes per day. The company also uses Copilot Dashboard to manage usage and gather user feedback, helping demonstrate ROI and measure results outside of time savings alone.

“Copilot changes the way we think and work while keeping us curious and open to embracing opportunities. I think that is the sort of benefit that is not so measurable, but important. So, my time management and structured approach to my everyday work life has been enhanced with Copilot and Viva.”

Martin Hvatum, Senior Global Cash Manager at Wallenius Wilhelmsen

I believe that no other company has a better foundation to facilitate your AI Transformation than Microsoft.

"Microsoft’s 2024 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report: Our most global, transparent report yet","Today, I am sharing Microsoft’s 2024 Diversity & Inclusion Report, our most global and transparent report to date. This marks our sixth consecutive annual report and the eleventh year sharing our global workforce data, highlighting our progress and areas of opportunity.

Our ongoing focus on diversity and inclusion is directly tied to our inherently inclusive mission — to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, enabling us to innovate in the era of AI. As we approach our company’s 50th anniversary, we remain deeply committed to D&I because it is what creates transformational solutions to the most complex challenges for customers, partners and the world.

Key data

We gather a range of data, which is presented in specific ways throughout the report. In the following section, it is important to understand the distinction between our *Broader Microsoft business and our **Core Microsoft business.

New and expanded data

Datacenters: As we lead the AI platform shift, our workforce continues to expand to include employees with varied backgrounds and roles, and we are sharing new data this year on a growing employee population in datacenter roles. The population of datacenter employees grew 23.9% globally and 28.9% in the US in 2024, more than tripling since 2020.
In our most global report to date, we expanded new global Self-ID data to include Indigenous and military employees, as well as those with disabilities. For example, 5.7% of global employees in our core Microsoft business self-identified as having a disability, an increase of 0.2 percentage points year over year.
We continue to have pay equity. For median unadjusted pay analysis, the data shows we have made progress in narrowing the gaps. This year we expanded pay equity analysis and median unadjusted pay analysis to not only include women inside and outside the US, but also include a combined view of women globally. Increasing representation for women and racial and ethnic minority groups at more senior levels, combined with maintaining pay equity for all, will continue to reduce the median unadjusted pay gap. 

Representation

Representation of women in our core Microsoft workforce is 31.6%, an increase of 0.4 percentage points year over year. Additionally, the representation of women in technical roles is 27.2%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points year over year.
Representation of women in our core Microsoft workforce rose year over year at all leadership levels except Executive.
Leadership representation in our core Microsoft workforce of Black and African American employees at the Partner + Executive level grew to 4.3%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points year over year. Leadership representation in our core Microsoft workforce of Hispanic and Latinx employees at the Executive level rose to 4.6%, an increase of 0.8 percentage points year over year.
In our broader Microsoft workforce, representation of racial and ethnic minority groups is 53.9%, an increase of 0.6 percentage points year over year.
Culture and inclusion in focus

Employee sentiment and engagement

Our semi-annual Employee Signals survey focuses on employee experience and helps us deepen our understanding so we can adjust our efforts where needed. These insights show that employees continue to feel like they are thriving, with a global and US score of 76. Within Employee Signals, we focus on thriving, which we define as “being energized and empowered to do meaningful work.” This is designed to measure employees’ sense of purpose, which is important to personal and professional fulfillment. We survey employees on three dimensions of thriving: Feeling energized, feeling empowered and doing meaningful work.
Our Daily Signals survey results indicate employee perceptions around Microsoft’s commitment to creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace increased two points year over year to an average score of 79.
Since introducing the concept of allyship to employees in 2018, we have inspired and led a positive impact on our culture. As of June 2024, 95.6% of employees reported some level of awareness of the concept of allyship, up from 65.0% in 2019 when we first started asking employees about their awareness.
A commitment that spans decades

Our annual D&I report not only reviews our data, but also illuminates the intentional strategy and actions that have helped us make progress across our company’s journey.

Examples include:

Being one of the first Fortune 500 companies to expand antidiscrimination policy and benefits to LGBTQIA+ employees in 1989.
Announcing our Racial Equity Initiative in June 2020, outlining actions and progress we expect to make by 2025 to help address racial injustice and inequity in the US for Black and African American communities.
Launching immersive D&I learning simulations in 2021, allowing employees to practice crucial D&I skills, such as recognizing and addressing bias, responding to microaggressions and demonstrating effective allyship.
Building on more than a decade of helping to reskill military service members through our Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA), and this year expanding this skilling opportunity to train military spouses for portable, in-demand IT roles.
Introducing pronouns and self-expression features in Microsoft 365, an innovation brought directly to fruition because we listened to, and collaborated with, customers, partners and employees who asked for these features.
A mission as bold as ours

At Microsoft, we’re guided by our mission, worldview and culture. Our mission is the why; it drives our actions. Our worldview is the what, shaping our strategy and products. Culture is the how, influencing everything with a focus on growth and innovation. Culture is also the who: Who makes up the workforce, who services our customers, who innovates the future of tech. The diversity of the workforce, combined with inclusion, unlocks individual and collective potential. This is what is necessary to stay relevant, compete at scale and win.

Every person. Every organization. Every day. Everywhere.

Here’s to making progress for the next 50 years.

Lindsay-Rae

New autonomous agents scale your team like never before,"
		Already, 60 percent of the Fortune 500 are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to accelerate business results and empower their teams. With Copilot supporting sales associates, Lumen Technologies projects $50 million dollars in savings annually. Honeywell(1) equates productivity gains to adding 187 full-time employees and Finastra is reducing creative production time from seven months to seven weeks.  
Today, we’re announcing new agentic capabilities that will accelerate these gains and bring AI-first business process to every organization. 

First, the ability to create autonomous agents with Copilot Studio will be in public preview next month.  


Second, we’re introducing ten new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365 to build capacity for every sales, service, finance and supply chain team. 

Copilot is your AI assistant — it works for you — and Copilot Studio enables you to easily create, manage and connect agents to Copilot. Think of agents as the new apps for an AI-powered world. Every organization will have a constellation of agents — ranging from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous. They will work on behalf of an individual, team or function to execute and orchestrate businesses process. Copilot is how you’ll interact with these agents, and they’ll do everything from accelerating lead generation and processing sales orders to automating your supply chain.  
Empowering more customers to build autonomous agents in Copilot Studio 
Earlier this year, we announced a host of powerful new capabilities in Copilot Studio, including the ability to create autonomous agents. Next month, these capabilities are shifting from private to public preview, allowing more customers to reimagine critical business processes with AI. Agents draw on the context of your work data in Microsoft 365 Graph, systems of record, Dataverse and Fabric, and can support everything from your IT help desk to employee onboarding and act as a personal concierge for sales and service.  
Organizations like Clifford Chance, McKinsey & Company, Pets at Home and Thomson Reuters are already creating autonomous agents to increase revenue, reduce costs and scale impact. Pets at Home, the U.K.’s leading pet care business, created an agent for its profit protection team to more efficiently compile cases for skilled human review, which could have the potential to drive a seven-figure annual savings. McKinsey & Company is creating an agent that will speed up the client onboarding process. The pilot showed lead time could be reduced by 90% and administrative work reduced by 30%. Thomson Reuters built a professional-grade agent to speed up the legal due diligence workflow, with initial testing showing some tasks could be done in half the time. This agent can help Thomson Reuters increase the efficiency of work for clients and boost its new business pipeline.  
Scaling your teams with 10 new autonomous agents in Dynamics 365  
New autonomous agents enable customers to move from legacy lines of business applications to AI-first business process. AI is today’s ROI and tomorrow’s competitive edge. These new agents are designed to help every sales, service, finance and supply chain team drive business value — and are just the start. We will create many more agents in the coming year that will give customers the competitive advantage they need to future-proof their organization. Today, we’re introducing ten of these autonomous agents. Here are a few examples: 

Sales Qualification Agent: In a profession where time literally equals money, this agent enables sellers to focus their time on the highest priority sales opportunities while the agent researches leads, helps prioritize opportunities and guides customer outreach with personalized emails and responses. 


Supplier Communications Agent: This agent enables customers to optimize their supply chain and minimize costly disruptions by autonomously tracking supplier performance, detecting delays and responding accordingly — freeing procurement teams from time consuming manual monitoring and firefighting. 


Customer Intent and Customer Knowledge Management Agents: A business gets one chance to make a first impression, and these two agents are game changers for customer care teams facing high call volumes, talent shortages and heightened customer expectations. These agents work hand in hand with a customer service representative by learning how to resolve customer issues and autonomously adding knowledge-based articles to scale best practices across the care team. 

As agents become more prevalent in the enterprise, customers want to be confident that they have robust data governance and security. The agents coming to Dynamics 365 follow our core security, privacy and responsible AI commitments. Agents built in Copilot Studio include guardrails and controls established by maker-defined instructions, knowledge and actions. The data sources linked to the agent adhere to stringent security measures and controls — all managed in Copilot Studio. These include data loss prevention, robust authentication protocols and more. Once these agents are created, IT administrators can apply a comprehensive set of features to govern their use. 
Microsoft’s own transformation  
At Microsoft, we’re using Copilot and agents to reimagine business process across every function while empowering employees to scale their impact. Using Copilot, one sales team has achieved 9.4% higher revenue per seller and closed 20% more deals(2). And thanks to Copilot, one team is resolving customer cases nearly 12% faster(3). Our Marketing team is seeing a 21.5% increase in conversion rate on Azure.com with a custom agent designed to assist buyers(4). And in Human Resources, our employee self-service agent is helping answer questions with 42% greater accuracy(5).  
With Copilot and agents, the possibilities are endless — we can’t wait to see what you create. Start building agents in Copilot Studio today.

Yet technology for its own sake counts for nothing. What matters is how it feels to people and what impact it has on societies. It’s about how it changes lives, opens doors, expands minds and relieves pressure. It is perhaps the greatest amplifier of human well-being in history, one of the most effective ways to create tangible and lasting benefits for billions of people.
And yet technology is, and must always remain, in service to humanity: an enabler and a path to deepening our common bonds and shared understanding, our energy and imagination, our creativity and our capacity for everything from invention to forming relationships.
In the field of AI, we often get caught up in the technical details. We spend our time talking about parameters and compute. The focus is on training runs, datacenters and the latest techniques. This is natural and inevitable when operating on the frontiers of something new, where the details do really matter. But I think it’s important that in doing all of this, getting stuck right in the technical weeds, we don’t lose sight of not only what we are building, but why we are building it.
At Microsoft AI, we are creating an AI companion for everyone.
I truly believe we can create a calmer, more helpful and supportive era of technology, quite unlike anything we’ve seen before. Great technology experiences are about how you feel, not what’s under the hood. It should be about what you experience, not what we are building.
Copilot will be there for you, in your corner, by your side and always strongly aligned with your interests. It understands the context of your life, while safeguarding your privacy, data and security, remembering the details that are most helpful in any situation. It gives you access to a universe of knowledge, simplifying and decluttering the daily barrage of information, and offering support and encouragement when you want it.
Over time it’ll adapt to your mannerisms and develop capabilities built around your preferences and needs. We are not creating a static tool so much as establishing a dynamic, emergent and evolving interaction. It will provide you with unwavering support to help you show up the way you really want in your everyday life, a new means of facilitating human connections and accomplishments alike.
With your permission, Copilot will ultimately be able to act on your behalf, smoothing life’s complexities and giving you more time to focus on what matters to you. It’ll be an advocate for you in many of life’s most important moments. It’ll accompany you to that doctor’s appointment, take notes and follow up at the right time. It’ll share the load of planning and preparing for your child’s birthday party. And it’ll be there at the end of the day to help you think through a tricky life decision.
Some people worry that AI will diminish what makes us unique as humans. My life’s work has been to ensure it does precisely the opposite. We choose what we create. This is something we must do together. Our task is to ensure AI always enriches people’s lives and strengthens our bonds with others, while supporting our uniqueness and endlessly complex humanity.
This is a new era of technology that doesn’t just “solve problems,” it’s there to support you, teach you and help you. In this sense, Copilot really is different from that last wave of the web and mobile. This is the beginning of a fundamental shift in what’s possible for all of us. It’s a long journey that will take years. With our latest updates to Copilot, you are seeing only the first careful steps in this direction.
Patience and care with our deployments are at the very foundation of our approach. My commitment is to be accountable at every stage, work with you and listen to you. Respect and deep compassion for our users and for society is the core purpose behind everything we do. It comes first. This is a journey we promise to take together. I couldn’t be more excited to embark on it with you.

Copilot Daily: Copilot Daily helps you kick off your morning with a summary of news and weather, all read in your favorite Copilot Voice, with more options like reminders of what’s coming soon. It’s an antidote for that familiar feeling of information overload. Clean, simple and easy to digest. Copilot Daily will only pull from authorized content sources. We are working with partners such as Reuters, Axel Springer, Hearst Magazines, USA TODAY Network and Financial Times, and plan to add more sources over time. We’ll also add additional personalization and controls in Copilot Daily over time.
Personalized Discover: Not sure where to start? Copilot Discover helps you get going, offering both a handy guide to its useful features and conversation starters, making jumping in simpler than ever. With your permission, these jumping off points are customized based on your interactions with other Microsoft services and will be further personalized over time according to your conversation history.

Copilot in Microsoft Edge: Copilot has been built right into your Microsoft Edge browser, quickly helping answer questions, summarize page content, translate text or rewrite a sentence. Now it’s even easier to access Copilot directly from the Microsoft Edge browser by simply typing @copilot into the address bar.
Copilot Labs: Copilot Labs gives people the opportunity to test out our experimental features that are still in development. It’s a chance to give feedback and help shape the experiences we create. We have two features we’re bringing to Labs initially, Copilot Vision and Think Deeper.
Copilot Vision: This is a profoundly new way of interacting with a computer. Copilot Vision sees what you see and can talk to you about it in real time. It understands the web page you’re viewing, both text and images, and can answer questions about its content, suggest next steps and help you without disrupting your workflow. Imagine you’re trying to furnish a new apartment, Copilot Vision can help you search for furniture, find the right color palette, think through your options on everything from rugs to throws and even suggest ways of arranging what you’re looking at.

Safety and security are our top priority here:

Copilot Vision sessions are entirely opt-in and ephemeral. None of the content Copilot Vision engages with is stored or used for training — the moment you end your session, data is permanently discarded.
The experience won’t work on all websites because we’ve taken important steps to put boundaries on the types of websites Copilot Vision can engage. We’re starting with a limited list of popular websites to help ensure it’s a safe experience for everyone.
Copilot Vision won’t work on paywalled and sensitive content for this preview. We’ve created it with both users’ and creators’ interests top of mind.
There is no specific processing of the content of a website you are browsing, nor any AI training. Copilot Vision simply reads and interprets the images and text it sees on the page for the first time along with you.
Before we launch broadly, we’ll continue to take feedback on all the above from early users in Copilot Labs, refine our safety measures and keep privacy and responsibility at the center of everything we do. Let us know what you think!

Think Deeper: Copilot can now reason through more complex questions. Think Deeper takes more time before responding, allowing Copilot to deliver detailed and step-by-step answers to challenging questions. We’ve designed it to be helpful for all kinds of practical and everyday challenges, like comparing two complex options side by side. Should I move to this city or that? What type of car best suits my needs? And so on. It’s an early Copilot Skill that’s still undergoing development, so we’ve placed it in our experimental Copilot Labs to test and get feedback.
We’re also making sure Copilot is easily available on all our platforms. On Copilot+ PCs and Windows we’re putting Copilot just a click away, unlocking new ways to interact with your PC. Check out today’s announcement on the latest with Copilot+ PCs and Windows.
Our work toward creating these kinds of experiences goes much further than just Copilot. Bing, Edge and MSN will also be more personalized, visual, cohesive and useful experiences than ever. For example, Bing generative search goes beyond simply finding an answer. Instead, it understands the search query, reviews millions of sources of information, dynamically matches content and generates search results on the fly.
While still under development, you’ll notice generative search rolling out across Bing starting today. To explore generative search in the US, simply search “Bing generative search” to choose from a selection of demo queries. We are also launching a new experience where users can more easily trigger Bing generative search for informational queries.
The refreshed Copilot is rolling out today on iOS and Android, through the Copilot web experience at copilot.microsoft.com and in Windows. We’re also excited to start rolling out Copilot to WhatsApp to help users there experience natural and engaging interactions with Copilot. Learn more here.
Notes:

Copilot Voice is initially available in English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States. Copilot Voice will expand to more regions and languages soon.
Copilot Daily is rolling out from today starting in the United States and the United Kingdom with more countries coming soon.
Personalization in Copilot follows our Microsoft Privacy Statement, and people can opt out at any time in Settings. We’re still finalizing options for offering personalization to users in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
Copilot Vision is rolling out to Copilot Labs soon and will be available to a limited number of Copilot Pro subscribers in the United States.
Think Deeper starts to roll out this week through Copilot Labs to a limited number of Copilot Pro users in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.

A year of DAX Copilot: Healthcare innovation that refocuses on the clinician-patient connection,"In 2012, a child’s drawing of her appointment with a physician was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). In the brightly colored sketch, the girl is sitting on the exam table accompanied by her mother and siblings. To those of us working in healthcare, her doctor is the most notable part of the image. He is sitting at his desk, typing on the computer — with his back to the patient.

This drawing, published alongside an article titled “The Cost of Technology,” is emblematic of the unintended consequences of healthcare innovation. With more tools for physicians to use and greater demands on their time, technology can easily become a barrier between the clinician and the patient. For example, in 2023 approximately 53% of physicians surveyed by Medscape reported feeling burned out, and 23% reported feeling depressed. Long working hours, bureaucratic demands and loss of work-life balance due to administrative requirements are leading causes. Our mission has always been to help clinicians turn their chairs around by providing the support they need to fully focus their attention on delivering care.

Fast-forward to today, and we’ve translated that goal into reality. After establishing the ambient technology category, we introduced DAX Copilot, the first generative AI voice-enabled solution, which has been generally available for one year, and we’re seeing remarkable momentum. Part of a proven and extensible platform, DAX Copilot leverages health systems’ existing investments in the trusted family of Dragon Medical solutions, which is used by more than 600,000 clinicians worldwide.

DAX Copilot combines proven conversational and ambient AI with generative AI to automatically convert multiparty conversations into specialty-specific standardized draft clinical summaries that integrate with existing workflows. DAX Copilot was the first ambient solution to be integrated into the Epic electronic health record (EHR) workflow and allows clinicians to seamlessly document patient visits directly within the EHR. Across the country, more than 400 organizations have already embraced its revolutionary capabilities, streamlining administrative tasks and lightening clinicians’ documentation workloads.

This transformative year has highlighted many of the ways we’re helping empower healthcare teams today and bringing joy back to practicing medicine for thousands of clinicians.

Improving access to care — and enhancing documentation quality

DAX Copilot is helping Northwestern Medicine in Chicago improve patient access to care, with physicians using the solution in at least 50% of patient encounters and able to see an average of 11.3 additional patients per month. DAX Copilot users at Northwestern Medicine also report spending an average of 24% less time on notes and a 17% decrease in “pajama time,” working on administrative tasks late into the night.

“Northwestern Medicine is committed to providing a superior work environment that promotes well-being, and implementing DAX Copilot will allow our physicians to spend more quality time with our patients, focusing on their needs rather than on paperwork and data entry,” says Dr. Gaurava Agarwal, chief wellness executive, Northwestern Medicine.

Overlake Medical Center & Clinics in Bellevue, Washington, deployed DAX Copilot to help reduce after-hours documentation time and equip its clinicians with tools to manage escalating demands. A pilot with 30 Overlake clinicians saw a significant reduction in time spent on notes outside of scheduled hours. Users also reported other important benefits: 81% said DAX Copilot had reduced their cognitive burden and 77% said the solution had improved the quality of their documentation.

At Atrium Health, “DAX Copilot is enabling a better clinician experience,” says Dr. Matthew Anderson, senior medical director of primary care at Atrium Health. “Most of our surveyed users are reporting a positive impact on their day-to-day schedule, being able to increase the number of patients they are able to see and even spending more time with them.”

Enhancing clinician well-being

Atrium Health isn’t alone in finding that the time saved on documentation with DAX Copilot is having a positive impact on clinicians’ quality of life. “I finally have weekends back,” says Dr. Christy Chan, a family medicine physician at Overlake. “I used to always have to worry that there was something I had to do — get back onto the EMR, log back in — but I actually have some weekends back.”

Clinicians at Novant Health are experiencing similar benefits. “DAX Copilot has done an amazing thing for the physicians and clinicians who are currently using it,” says Dr. Aram Alexanian, a family physician at Novant Health. “When you hear a comment like ‘I am now able to do things with my daughter in the evenings and weekends that I couldn’t do before,’ nothing satisfies us more than knowing the impact DAX is having on our clinicians.”

DAX Copilot can accurately identify different voices in the room during pediatric visits, differentiating between parents and children to accurately capture the patient exam note for the physician to review and approve.

Community Health Network places a major focus on clinician well-being and implementing DAX Copilot has had a major impact on its clinicians’ ability to close notes before they leave for the day. “Since we have implemented DAX Copilot, I have not left clinic with an open note,” says Dr. Patrick McGill, chief transformation officer for Community Health Network. “We have seen improved access, improved numbers of patients, but overall, it’s really the clinician satisfaction that we’ve seen. In one word, DAX Copilot is transformative. It transforms how we’re able to deliver care and how we’re able to document it. It also transforms the patient experience.”

“DAX Copilot has made my professional life easier. My patients have also benefited from my using Nuance DAX during our appointments. I can be right there with the patient and not furiously writing notes. I cannot thank you enough,” said Anita M. Kelsey, M.D., Duke Health.

Transforming the patient experience 

Dr. Dominick Lanzo, an orthopedic surgeon at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, agrees. “Once I introduced the DAX Copilot program, it completely transformed the patient experience, and it’s turned out to be incredibly accurate with regards to the history of present illness and the physical exam,” he says. “It’s made my practice much more efficient. I can see more patients, my notes are more accurate, and they’re done in a timely fashion by the end of the afternoon.”

For Dr. Alison Pomykala, an internal medicine specialist at Baptist Medical Group, the integration of DAX Copilot with the Epic EHR is particularly valuable. “The thing I like most about DAX Copilot embedded in the Epic workflow is I’m able to focus more on the patient and I’m spending less time in the exam room typing on the computer,” she says.

“I think the interface is wonderful with Epic. It has been great to see the notes coming up basically in real time on the Epic system. That’s also helped with other things: where we needed to generate a note quickly for referrals, for insurance pre-certifications, for imaging studies, or to have a complete note ready for a patient that we’re sending to the hospital.”

“At our academic health system, integrating DAX Copilot has revolutionized patient care,” says Dr. Anthony Mazzarelli, co-president and CEO at Cooper University Health Care. “By automating clinical documentation through ambient voice technology, it has significantly reduced administrative workloads. This allows our physicians to focus on real-time patient interactions, leading to better care outcomes and increased job satisfaction. DAX Copilot has not only improved efficiency but has also empowered our team to spend more time where it matters most — caring for patients.”

It’s a privilege to see this industry-leading solution make a meaningful difference for the clinicians who are already on board — but the work never stops. The Microsoft healthcare team is determined to continue solving some of the industry’s most complex challenges, and harnessing the power and potential of AI is how we’ll achieve that. We will continue to be leaders in innovation, collaborating across our ecosystem of incredible customers, partners and Microsoft researchers to bring real impact to clinical settings.

DAX Copilot is an innovative solution that goes beyond documentation, offering unique features such as orders, problem-based charting and pre-charting capabilities. For example, recent updates to DAX Copilot include a robust set of features, such as the ability to customize documentation style and formatting, as well as automatically create referral letters, diagnostic evidence, after-visit summaries and encounter summaries. The solution also now offers AI coaching to help users improve the quality and completeness of their notes. Also, the new Summarized Evidence capability offers a comprehensive and sophisticated approach that helps clinicians validate and trust the note output by combining insights that go beyond evidence linking, helping clinicians validate the note.

Importantly, when creating technologies that can change the world, Microsoft believes organizations need to ensure that the technology is used responsibly. Microsoft is committed to creating responsible AI by design that is guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency and accountability.

DAX Copilot is helping restore the human connection at the heart of medicine. We’re excited to drive this solution forward and expand its reach to more clinicians over the coming year and beyond.

Today, the solution can be used across ambulatory specialties, in-office primary care and urgent care, telehealth and emergency medicine. And we are scaling the solution’s availability and capabilities to even more care settings, such as nursing and geographies.

As AI advances, we all have a role to play to unlock AI’s positive impact for organizations and communities around the world. That’s why we’re focused on helping customers use and build AI that is trustworthy, meaning AI that is secure, safe and private.
At Microsoft, we have commitments to ensure Trustworthy AI and are building industry-leading supporting technology. Our commitments and capabilities go hand in hand to make sure our customers and developers are protected at every layer.
Building on our commitments, today we are announcing new product capabilities to strengthen the security, safety and privacy of AI systems.
Security. Security is our top priority at Microsoft, and our expanded Secure Future Initiative (SFI) underscores the company-wide commitments and the responsibility we feel to make our customers more secure. This week we announced our first SFI Progress Report, highlighting updates spanning culture, governance, technology and operations. This delivers on our pledge to prioritize security above all else and is guided by three principles: secure by design, secure by default and secure operations. In addition to our first party offerings, Microsoft Defender and Purview, our AI services come with foundational security controls, such as built-in functions to help prevent prompt injections and copyright violations. Building on those, today we’re announcing two new capabilities:

Evaluations in Azure AI Studio to support proactive risk assessments.
Microsoft 365 Copilot will provide transparency into web queries to help admins and users better understand how web search enhances the Copilot response. Coming soon.

Our security capabilities are already being used by customers. Cummins, a 105-year-old company known for its engine manufacturing and development of clean energy technologies, turned to Microsoft Purview to strengthen their data security and governance by automating the classification, tagging and labeling of data. EPAM Systems, a software engineering and business consulting company, deployed Microsoft 365 Copilot for 300 users because of the data protection they get from Microsoft. J.T. Sodano, Senior Director of IT, shared that “we were a lot more confident with Copilot for Microsoft 365, compared to other large language models (LLMs), because we know that the same information and data protection policies that we’ve configured in Microsoft Purview apply to Copilot.”
Safety. Inclusive of both security and privacy, Microsoft’s broader Responsible AI principles, established in 2018, continue to guide how we build and deploy AI safely across the company. In practice this means properly building, testing and monitoring systems to avoid undesirable behaviors, such as harmful content, bias, misuse and other unintended risks. Over the years, we have made significant investments in building out the necessary governance structure, policies, tools and processes to uphold these principles and build and deploy AI safely. At Microsoft, we are committed to sharing our learnings on this journey of upholding our Responsible AI principles with our customers. We use our own best practices and learnings to provide people and organizations with capabilities and tools to build AI applications that share the same high standards we strive for.
Today, we are sharing new capabilities to help customers pursue the benefits of AI while mitigating the risks:

A Correction capability in Microsoft Azure AI Content Safety’s Groundedness detection feature that helps fix hallucination issues in real time before users see them.
Embedded Content Safety, which allows customers to embed Azure AI Content Safety on devices. This is important for on-device scenarios where cloud connectivity might be intermittent or unavailable.
New evaluations in Azure AI Studio to help customers assess the quality and relevancy of outputs and how often their AI application outputs protected material.
Protected Material Detection for Code is now in preview in Azure AI Content Safety to help detect pre-existing content and code. This feature helps developers explore public source code in GitHub repositories, fostering collaboration and transparency, while enabling more informed coding decisions.

It’s amazing to see how customers across industries are already using Microsoft solutions to build more secure and trustworthy AI applications. For example, Unity, a platform for 3D games, used Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to build Muse Chat, an AI assistant that makes game development easier. Muse Chat uses content-filtering models in Azure AI Content Safety to ensure responsible use of the software. Additionally, ASOS, a UK-based fashion retailer with nearly 900 brand partners, used the same built-in content filters in Azure AI Content Safety to support top-quality interactions through an AI app that helps customers find new looks.
We’re seeing the impact in the education space too. New York City Public Schools partnered with Microsoft to develop a chat system that is safe and appropriate for the education context, which they are now piloting in schools. The South Australia Department for Education similarly brought generative AI into the classroom with EdChat, relying on the same infrastructure to ensure safe use for students and teachers.
Privacy. Data is at the foundation of AI, and Microsoft’s priority is to help ensure customer data is protected and compliant through our long-standing privacy principles, which include user control, transparency and legal and regulatory protections. To build on this, today we’re announcing:

Confidential inferencing in preview in our Azure OpenAI Service Whisper model, so customers can develop generative AI applications that support verifiable end-to-end privacy. Confidential inferencing ensures that sensitive customer data remains secure and private during the inferencing process, which is when a trained AI model makes predictions or decisions based on new data. This is especially important for highly regulated industries, such as healthcare, financial services, retail, manufacturing and energy.
The general availability of Azure Confidential VMs with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, which allow customers to secure data directly on the GPU. This builds on our confidential computing solutions, which ensure customer data stays encrypted and protected in a secure environment so that no one gains access to the information or system without permission.
Azure OpenAI Data Zones for the EU and US are coming soon and build on the existing data residency provided by Azure OpenAI Service by making it easier to manage the data processing and storage of generative AI applications. This new functionality offers customers the flexibility of scaling generative AI applications across all Azure regions within a geography, while giving them the control of data processing and storage within the EU or US.

We’ve seen increasing customer interest in confidential computing and excitement for confidential GPUs, including from application security provider F5, which is using Azure Confidential VMs with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs to build advanced AI-powered security solutions, while ensuring confidentiality of the data its models are analyzing. And multinational banking corporation Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) has integrated Azure confidential computing into their own platform to analyze encrypted data while preserving customer privacy. With the general availability of Azure Confidential VMs with NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs, RBC can now use these advanced AI tools to work more efficiently and develop more powerful AI models.

Achieve more with Trustworthy AI 
We all need and expect AI we can trust. We’ve seen what’s possible when people are empowered to use AI in a trusted way, from enriching employee experiences and reshaping business processes to reinventing customer engagement and reimagining our everyday lives. With new capabilities that improve security, safety and privacy, we continue to enable customers to use and build trustworthy AI solutions that help every person and organization on the planet achieve more. Ultimately, Trustworthy AI encompasses all that we do at Microsoft and it’s essential to our mission as we work to expand opportunity, earn trust, protect fundamental rights and advance sustainability across everything we do.

Microsoft announces the best performing logical qubits on record and will provide priority access to reliable quantum hardware in Azure Quantum,"At Microsoft, we’re ushering in a new era of computing on the path to unlocking scientific advantage and tackling some of the world’s most pressing challenges. This is why we’re building Azure Quantum — to create the first platform for reliable quantum computing and achieve the vision of quantum at scale.

In April, we announced we’re entering the next phase for solving meaningful problems with reliable quantum computers by demonstrating the most reliable logical qubits with an error rate 800x better than physical qubits. The main issue with today’s noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines is that their physical qubits are too noisy and error-prone, making the machines impractical for real-world applications. That’s why we must transition to using reliable logical qubits that combine multiple physical qubits together to protect against noise and to maintain coherence for long-running computations.

But quantum computing doesn’t exist in isolation. It requires deep integration with the power of the cloud. We must leverage the best of computing to unlock a new generation of hybrid quantum applications that could solve some of our most pressing challenges — from pioneering more sustainable energy solutions to transforming how we treat disease with the next generation of life-saving therapeutics.

We designed the Azure Quantum compute platform to provide quantum computing across a variety of hardware architectures, enabling the most advanced hybrid quantum applications in the industry — all in a secure, unified and scalable cloud environment — to tackle classically intractable problems. This is our vision for Azure Quantum. Today, we continue to make advances that bring us closer to achieving it with our industry-leading partners, Quantinuum and Atom Computing. With both companies, we want to bring best-in-class solutions to the Azure Quantum platform, and collectively advance and scale resilient quantum capabilities.

In collaboration with Quantinuum, we applied our improved qubit-virtualization system to create and entangle 12 highly reliable logical qubits. This represents the largest number of entangled logical qubits, with the highest fidelity, on record. These results scale logical qubit computation — on ion-trap hardware — within our Azure Quantum compute platform. In addition, advancing toward scalable quantum computing necessitates not only reaching significant hardware milestones, but also proving these improvements can address practical and real-world challenges.

This is why we demonstrated the first end-to-end chemistry simulation that combines reliable logical quantum computation with cloud high-performance computing (HPC) and AI. Today’s announcements would not have been possible without Quantinuum’s leading quantum machines. This paves the way toward practical solutions at the intersection of these technologies, especially in the domains of chemistry, physics and life sciences.

Lastly, as we expand our Azure Quantum compute platform, we are excited to announce that Microsoft and Atom Computing are coming together to ultimately build the world’s most powerful quantum machine. Through this collaboration, we’re bringing a new generation of reliable quantum hardware to customers by integrating and advancing Atom Computing’s neutral-atom hardware into our Azure Quantum compute platform. With it, we are bringing the best-in-class from Microsoft and our partner ecosystem to provide the commercial offering of a reliable quantum machine.

Combining the capabilities of this reliable quantum hardware with our platform for Science, Azure Elements, we are providing a comprehensive discovery suite to achieve scientific quantum advantage.

Creating a new generation of hybrid quantum applications

At Microsoft, we’re pioneering a new computing paradigm by bringing the power of the cloud and AI together with quantum. Our Azure Quantum compute platform enables the seamless execution of quantum applications that leverage hardware across a variety of qubit architectures and chips, while offering integration with cloud HPC and AI. Over this past year, we’ve continued to announce new breakthroughs and collaborations in pursuit of this platform mission, including offering Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DFT and advancing the industry to reliable quantum computing by demonstrating highly reliable logical qubits.

We are bringing these technologies together in a purpose-built cloud platform that leverages the complementary strengths of both AI for large-scale data processing and quantum for complex calculations and unprecedented accuracy. This strong compute foundation offers a secure, unified and scalable hybrid computing environment that enables innovators to develop best-in-class solutions for tackling problems that are difficult or even intractable on classical computers. We are integrating quantum hardware architectures from our ecosystem partners with our quantum control, processing and error correction software — in addition to capabilities for copilot-assisted workflows, developer tools, classical supercomputing and multimodal AI models. This differentiated computing stack will pave the way for this new generation of hybrid applications. AI co-reasoning will help articulate problems and translate them into workflows, using both classical and scaled quantum tools at the right stages to drive impactful insights in an iterative loop to compress R&D and time-to-solution into days, not years.

Continuing to implement reliable quantum computing with Quantinuum 

Today, in collaboration with Quantinuum, we’re proud to announce the demonstration of the best performing logical qubits on record, achieving the largest number of entangled logical qubits. We created 12 logical qubits by improving and optimizing our qubit-virtualization system for Quantinuum’s 56-physical-qubits H2 machine.

This progress speaks to the world-class error correction expertise at Microsoft. In less than six months, our improved qubit-virtualization system tripled reliable logical qubit counts. Furthermore, when we entangled all 12 logical qubits in a complex state required for ‘deeper’ quantum computation, they exhibited a 22X circuit error rate improvement over the corresponding physical qubits. 

The ability of our systems to triple the number of logical qubits while less than doubling our physical qubits from 30 to 56 physical qubits is a testament to the high fidelities and all-to-all connectivity of our H-Series trapped-ion hardware. Our current H2-1 hardware combined with Microsoft’s qubit-virtualization system is bringing us and our customers fully into Level 2 resilient quantum computing. This powerful collaboration will unlock even greater advancements when combined with the cutting-edge AI and HPC tools delivered through Azure Quantum.

— Rajeeb Hazra, CEO of Quantinuum

With our improved error correction code and qubit-virtualization system, we’ve demonstrated a 22X improvement between physical and logical circuit error rates when entangled.

As we continue to strive toward scientific and industrial breakthroughs with quantum computers, noise remains our biggest barrier. In a previous post, I highlighted how increasing the number of physical qubits alone is not enough to make robust quantum error correction possible. As part of the quantum ecosystem, we must remain focused on improving both logical qubit counts and fidelity to have a solid foundation for producing meaningful results. This will be possible through hardware and software advancements that together enable running longer and more reliable quantum applications. Today’s announcement demonstrates that it is possible to realize these fundamental capabilities on the path to large-scale quantum computing.

A true computing paradigm shift also requires a focus on practical and commercially relevant applications. Earlier, we successfully completed a chemistry simulation in the first end-to-end workflow that combined HPC, AI and logical qubit computation to predict the ground state energy for a specific catalyst problem. This demonstration marked a critical step toward ushering in a new generation of hybrid applications that will become increasingly impactful as quantum technologies scale. Quantum and AI will have the earliest significant impact on scientific discovery, and researchers at Microsoft have demonstrated the breakthrough potential of this integration. This work was only possible thanks to our long-standing and close collaboration with Quantinuum, a company that remains at the forefront of quantum computing.

You can learn more about today’s improved logical qubits and the technical details about this chemistry simulation in our blog Microsoft and Quantinuum create 12 logical qubits and demonstrate a hybrid, end-to-end chemistry simulation.

Empowering every scientist with AI-augmented scientific discovery,"
		At Microsoft, our vision is to empower scientists with the latest breakthroughs in AI to unlock their full creative potential and tackle some of our most pressing challenges. This vision will require bringing the full power of generative AI together with quantum-classical hybrid computing to augment every stage of the scientific method. Whether expanding knowledge research, creating better hypotheses, or accelerating experimentation and analyses, doing so demands a purpose-built cloud platform for science. This is why we built Azure Quantum Elements for chemistry and materials science.
Today, we’re announcing Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DFT, which will expand the ways researchers can harness the full power of this platform. These breakthrough capabilities will empower scientists to compress the next 250 years of chemistry into the next 25.
With Generative Chemistry, we want to broaden the horizons of scientific exploration. Researchers can generate and explore novel molecules suited for specific industry applications using the latest AI models trained on hundreds of millions of compounds, and then evaluate the steps suggested by the workflow for synthesizing the most promising candidates in a lab more efficiently — all in a matter of days rather than years.
With Accelerated DFT, researchers can expedite and scale their chemical discovery pipelines by simulating the quantum-mechanical properties of molecules at an unprecedented speed — an order of magnitude faster compared to other Density Functional Theory (DFT) codes.
This brings us closer to a new paradigm for scientific discovery, where advanced AI and digital tools are more accessible than ever to scientists, students, and labs across industries. Below is our vision for how researchers will be able to leverage these breakthrough capabilities to design new molecules and enable the transformation of entire sectors from consumer goods and medicine, to manufacturing and energy, in turn addressing some of our most pressing societal challenges.

We’re working towards this vision today. As part of the private preview of Azure Quantum Elements, scientists and developers have the opportunity to explore Accelerated DFT today, with the potential to access Generative Chemistry in the coming weeks. 
We’re already putting our vision into practice by collaborating with Unilever, a global leader in consumer goods, which serves over 3.4 billion people every single day. Unilever is harnessing the power of Microsoft supercomputing and AI services to support their digital R&D transformation and product innovation.
Integrating AI into every stage of the scientific method
From global ambitions like reversing climate change and pioneering renewable energy sources to personal ones like living more sustainably and using healthier and safer products, we all want to do our part to create a better world. Time is of the essence for many of these goals, with more than 8 million scientists1 around the globe working to pioneer innovative solutions and unlock progress. At Microsoft, we aim to empower them with state-of-the-art digital tools to harness the full collective ingenuity of every researcher and lab around the world.
Just as generative AI has unleashed new waves of creativity and improved productivity with collaborative tools like Copilot, we are now bringing AI and natural language processing capabilities to science. Our goal is to integrate AI reasoning into every stage of the scientific method: this requires the power of next-generation AI models to speed up the scientific process from hypothesis to results. It starts with knowledge research and hypothesis generation, connecting the dots by generating millions of potential molecular candidate solutions, then narrowing down candidates with digital experiments and analyzing the outcomes — all in a matter of days. We demonstrated how this approach can land real-world results in our collaboration with PNNL, where we screened over 32 million candidates to discover and synthesize a new material that holds the potential for better batteries — a tangible example of the possibilities in this new era of scientific discovery.
When powered by natural language tools, this new paradigm will help create an autonomous reasoning loop with AI at every stage as a scientific assistant. It will redefine how we approach innovation by democratizing these capabilities for breakthrough discoveries.
Our goal is to integrate AI into every stage of the scientific method, from initial research and hypothesis generation to experimentation and analysis.
Announcing new capabilities in Azure Quantum Elements
Generative Chemistry will unleash a new wave of creativity for scientists tasked with discovering and designing new molecules. This will enable breakthrough growth across many industries, whether helping an oil and gas company discover a stronger fuel additive for enhancing the longevity of engine life, or an adhesive firm creating a new chemical for strengthening adhesion while removing unwanted residue.
We could compare this discovery process to searching for a small box in a large, crowded and dark warehouse with one small flashlight. We can only focus the light on a small area at a time while the rest of the warehouse remains completely dark and unknown. Generative AI gives us a much smarter light that can point in new directions, providing visibility where we may not have considered – or have been able – to look before.
Researchers can ask Generative Chemistry for molecules with desired characteristics, such as the ability to degrade rapidly or be recycled more easily. They can also provide information about their targeted application and let the system help determine relevant molecular properties. After a few more steps, they receive a set of candidates — matching those parameters — for further study.
However, simply generating candidates is not sufficient for transforming the discovery process with AI. The essential criteria for computational tools in chemistry are that they help scientists discover molecules that are novel, synthesizable and useful in the real world. This is why I’m excited to see our approach to Generative Chemistry come to life, suggesting molecules that have not been seen before, with useful properties tuned for a specific application, and whose synthesis is feasible in a reasonable number of steps.
For this reason, Generative Chemistry will offer researchers potential steps to consider as they develop their “recipe” for synthesizing these molecular candidates in a laboratory. Support for this critical component has been developed from the capabilities of our AutoRXN software, exploring chemical reactions in reverse order, which can help to evaluate synthesis pathways for creating a target molecule.
After scientists specify the desired characteristics of a molecule, they receive thousands of molecular candidates that can be further refined through AI inferences and subsequent HPC simulations, arriving at a select few that show the most promise for laboratory synthesis and further experimental exploration.
This capability is truly groundbreaking for scientific discovery. Businesses and research groups can look for efficient, cost-effective and innovative methods to develop new molecules in a matter of days, compressing the iterative process of extensive database searches and trial-and-error laboratory experiments. This end-to-end workflow will provide scientists with entirely new compounds that could lead to the next breakthrough in manufacturing, medicine and more.
We’re also announcing Accelerated DFT to offer a simplified and more powerful quantum chemistry solution for scientists. For the past few decades, DFT has been an extremely popular method used across a variety of molecular simulations, helping researchers to simulate and study the electronic structure of atoms, molecules and nanoparticles, as well as surfaces and interfaces.
We can liken molecular systems to traffic systems, where cars moving in various directions at different speeds represent electrons. From a traffic helicopter, we can observe the overall flow of traffic even if we don’t know each car’s speed and destination. DFT provides this “helicopter view’” of molecular systems, simplifying the complex task of tracking individual electrons by instead mapping out the “density” of them at a higher altitude.
Such DFT simulations can be complex to optimize and run, and often require supercomputer-scale resources. This is why our managed DFT service, based on innovation developed by Microsoft Research, enables researchers to perform substantially faster calculations than other DFT codes and offers a 20-fold average increase in speed compared to PySCF, a widely used open-source DFT code.
Accelerated DFT is already used by many organizations such as AspenTech, DTU Energy University of Denmark and Unilever. It seamlessly integrates into broader chemistry and materials science workflows, and paves the way for expediting innovations in therapeutics, environmental sustainability and beyond.
You can learn more about this announcement in the technical blog, Introducing two powerful new capabilities in Azure Quantum Elements: Generative Chemistry and Accelerated DFT.

With Copilot and the advanced simulation capabilities of Azure Quantum Elements, Unilever can query scientific information using natural language, performing thousands of computational simulations in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory experiments. Unilever scientists can use the data gathered from these simulations to fine-tune models that screen tens of thousands of materials at substantial speed or enable the exploration of intricate chemical reactions.
For example, R&D teams can expand their search space for novel molecules that restore natural bonds in hair fibers across more hair types, in turn redefining the standards of personalized hair care for brands like Dove and TRESemmé. Furthermore, by placing scaled simulations at the forefront of the discovery funnel, Unilever will be further empowered to expedite the delivery of solutions within their key sustainability focus areas.
“Digital tools are unlocking an unprecedented age of scientific discovery. Using advanced computing power and AI, we are able to compress decades of lab work into days, accessing a level of insight we could not previously have imagined. This technological leap, coupled with our vast repository of proprietary data and a century of expertise in personal and household care, means our scientists are able to lead the industry in developing the next generation of consumer goods.”
— Alberto Prado, Global Head of R&D Digital and Partnerships at Unilever
Expanding quantum capabilities in Azure Quantum Elements
We stand on the cusp of unprecedented innovation, and at Microsoft, we continue to pioneer state-of-the-art solutions to usher in a new era of scientific discovery. We remain focused on achieving scaled quantum computing and more breakthroughs on our path to engineering our topological qubits with inherent hardware-level stability.
Earlier this year, we demonstrated with Quantinuum the most reliable logical qubits on record, further advancing the state-of-the-art for quantum computing. And recently, we simulated a chemical catalyst combining classical supercomputers, AI and logical qubits created with Microsoft’s qubit-virtualization system and Quantinuum’s H1 hardware. This combination holds the key to unlocking scientific breakthroughs enabled by a new generation of hybrid-computing applications.
In the coming months, we will bring advanced logical qubit capabilities using our software and Quantinuum’s hardware in private preview in Azure Quantum Elements. As logical qubit capabilities scale to deliver increasingly reliable results, we will unlock simulation accuracy, moving us from scientific advantage to commercial advantage, and ultimately to solving some of the world’s most pressing problems.

Satya Nadella remarks at the 2024 G7 Summit,"At the 2024 G7 Summit in Fasano, Italy, President Biden and other G7 leaders met with private sector executives, including Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, to reaffirm their commitment to accelerate sustainable infrastructure investment through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. Below are Satya’s remarks at the event.

Thank you very much, Prime Minister Meloni and President Biden for the opportunity this afternoon to really participate in this very important discussion about scaling the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment to support very high-quality infrastructure, financing in low-and-middle-income countries. It’s encouraging to see the partnership expand and gain momentum.  

As this partnership has recognized, we are entering a very new age, driven by AI, which has made clear the critical importance of both digital infrastructure and connectivity in every sector of the economy and every corner of the world, as well as energy. 

There is no doubt that AI is one of the most transformative technologies of our time, and we believe it will fundamentally bend the productivity curve for every individual, organization, and industry sector to help us address some of our most pressing global challenges, including in the world’s low-income countries. 

At Microsoft we have this saying where we say that we will only succeed if the world around is fundamentally succeeding. We are therefore very, very focused on ensuring that every country can benefit from this broad technological shift, while mitigating its risks.  

This presents a pretty unique opportunity to help address the economic development and societal priorities, everywhere in the world, whether it’s small businesses becoming more productive, whether it’s the multinationals in every part of the world becoming more competitive, globally, governments becoming more efficient, improving health outcomes and education outcomes. 

Over the past three months, for example, we have invested $5 billion in cloud and AI infrastructure in Indonesia and Malaysia and Thailand, as well as in Kenya, together with our partners G42 of the UAE. This is work designed to drive that broad spectrum of economic growth, innovation, and connectivity to drive productivity.  

But we recognize that this requires more than just infrastructure, which is why we have also launched initiatives to provide broad-based AI skilling opportunities, strengthen cybersecurity, and support startups and innovative companies around the world.  

We have already seen many examples of this impact in action. I was in Indonesia recently and I saw how Indonesian farmers are improving their yields. To Kenyan street vendors who now have access to credit for the first time.  

We also have noted that the infrastructure of the future has to be sustainable, and so this is why we are investing in carbon-free energy, as well as efforts to develop greener steel and concrete in order to build our data centers, and also make our silicon more carbon-free and efficient. 

At the same time, this ambition is not something that any one company, or for that matter, any one country can accomplish on its own. This requires broad partnerships across the private and public sectors. 

For example, we need regulatory innovation to enable multiple countries to share digital infrastructure when located in neighboring regions. That’s what we did in Kenya, where we created a trusted data zone for the East Africa community, in partnership with the government and G42. This ensures governments and companies across the region can store their data in our data center with the assurance that their own privacy and cybersecurity and other legal rules and protections will continue to be applied. 

This is just one example of the type of partnership and innovation and regulatory involvement that is required in order to be able to really drive this next generation of infrastructure. 

To close, I’m incredibly optimistic about our collective opportunity, and I’m looking forward to working together in helping people and organizations around the world as they apply this new generation of technology to grow and thrive. 

Thank you all, very much. "
Announcing Dynamics 365 Contact Center – a Copilot-first cloud contact center to transform service experiences,"
		Today we are thrilled to announce the latest milestone in our journey towards modernizing customer service: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center, a Copilot-first contact center solution that delivers generative AI to every customer engagement channel. With general availability on July 1, this standalone Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solution enables customers to maximize their current investments by connecting to preferred customer relationship management systems (CRMs) or custom apps.

Modernizing service experiences with generative AI
Customer service expectations are higher than ever. It’s not only frustrating for customers to deal with long wait times, being transferred to the wrong agent or having to repeat themselves multiple times — it’s detrimental to business. When people have poor customer service experiences, over half of them end up spending less or decide to take their business elsewhere (Qualtrics).
Generative AI is transforming customer service and revolutionizing the way contact centers operate — from delivering rich experiences across digital and voice channels that enable customers to resolve their own needs, to equipping agents with relevant context within the flow of work, and ultimately unifying operations to drive efficiency and reduce costs.
We have experienced the transformational impact of generative AI firsthand with Microsoft’s Customer Service and Support (CSS) team, one of the largest customer service organizations in the world. Before the support team migrated to Microsoft’s own tools, CSS was previously using 16 different systems and over 500 individual tools — slowing down service, hindering collaboration and producing inefficient workflows. With Copilot as part of the solution, the CSS team achieved a 12 percent decrease in average handle time for chat engagements and 13 percent decrease in agents requiring peer assistance to resolve an incident. And more broadly, CSS has seen a 31 percent increase in first call resolution and a 20 percent reduction in missed routes.
Dynamics 365 Contact Center
Applying learnings and insights from our own Copilot usage, coupled with multi-year investments in voice and digital channels, Dynamics 365 Contact Center infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow — spanning the channels of communication, self-service, intelligent routing, agent-assisted service and operations to help contact centers solve problems faster, empower agents and reduce costs.
Additionally, Dynamics 365 Contact Center is built natively on the Microsoft cloud to deliver extensive scalability and reliability across voice, digital channels and routing while at the same time allowing organizations to retain their existing investments in CRM or custom apps.
Key Dynamics 365 Contact Center capabilities include:

Next-generation self-service: With sophisticated pre-integrated Copilots for digital and voice channels that drive context-aware, personalized conversations, contact centers can deploy rich self-service experiences. Combining the best of interactive voice response (IVR) technology from Nuance and Microsoft Copilot Studio’s no-code/low-code designer, contact centers can provide customers with engaging, individualized experiences powered by generative AI.
Accelerated human-assisted service: Across every channel, intelligent unified routing steers incoming requests that require a human touch to the agent best suited to help, enhancing service quality and efficiency. When a customer reaches an agent, Dynamics 365 Contact Center gives the agent a 360-degree view of the customer with generative AI — for example, real-time conversation tools like sentiment analysis, translation, conversation summary, transcription and more are included to help improve service, along with others that automate repetitive tasks for agents such as case summary, draft an email, suggested response and the ability for Copilot to answer agent questions grounded on your trusted knowledge sources.
Operational efficiency: Contact center efficiency depends just as much on what happens behind the scenes as it does on customer and agent experiences. We’ve built a solution that helps service teams detect issues early, improve critical KPIs and adapt quickly. With generative AI-based, real-time reporting, Dynamics 365 Contact Center allows service leaders to optimize contact center operations across all support channels, including their workforce.

Here’s what customers are saying:

“At 1-800-Flowers.com, we pride ourselves on exceptional service and continually raising the bar. With Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center, we’re creating a best-in-class solution that furthers our mission and helps inspire people to give more, connect more, and build more and better relationships.” — Arnie Leap, CIO, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.
“MSC has always been known for the personal service that we give to our customers; Microsoft Dynamics 365 Contact Center helps us elevate that customer-centric approach.”— Fabio Catassi, CIO, Mediterranean Shipping Company
“For our support teams, efficient problem-solving and smooth customer interactions are key to delivering exceptional service. With Dynamics 365 Contact Center and by leveraging its AI capabilities, we see a future where our support teams will deliver that level of service every day.”— Stephen Currie, Vice President Support Operations, Synoptek

If you’re attending Customer Contact Week in Las Vegas, join me for my main stage panel on Thursday, June 6. Be sure to also stop by the Microsoft booth (#151) during the event to see Dynamics 365 Contact Center in action.
Stay tuned for the general availability of Dynamics 365 Contact Center on July 1.

Celebrating Pride and ‘Radical Joy’,"In the face of adversity, the ability to continue to move forward, inspire and spark change is something to celebrate. Even small change is hugely meaningful because progress often comes from small steps of affirmation, resistance and perhaps, even most importantly, celebration. That’s why the LGBTQIA+ communities at Microsoft centered our 2024 Pride campaign on the idea of “Radical joy.” The joy that radiates and inspires. The joy that is not dependent on outside forces but is within us and within our control, and when expressed, can help make change for all and inspire others to do the same. “Radical joy” is an anthem to those who thrive against all odds.

Discover everything Pride at unlocked.microsoft.com/pride.

Stories of joy

This year’s campaign is an ode to the strength and power of the LGBTQIA+ communities. The LGBTQIA+ community is the heart of this movement, and employees are the heart of Microsoft. Eight Microsoft employees shared their radical joy stories, reminding us of the why behind Pride and uniting us in furthering its mission.

Microsoft employees share what Pride and “Radical joy” means to them.
Open source and spreading joy

“Radical joy” is grounded in inclusion and acceptance, values that are important for us at Microsoft. One of the many ways we are celebrating them at Pride is by highlighting the interconnected and intersectional nature of LGBTQIA+ communities. Our designs unite 74 flags representing different LGBTQIA+ identities through vibrant abstract shapes that nod to the joy and power that radiates from and through the community year-round. This year’s graphic expands representation to 25 new communities and is localized for use in 33 languages.

For the third year in a row, Microsoft invites everyone to spread LGBTQIA+ acceptance and inclusion by sharing stories, open sourcing the entire Pride campaign design to remix and share, as we have found time and time again, participation is key to the community and its allies. For the first time, this year, we invite you to leverage AI to create even more Pride by sharing your own stories with fast and easy AI-powered tools like Microsoft Designer and Clipchamp to make your own Pride stickers, social posts and more.

Together with our employees, Microsoft has donated over $16 million to organizations that support LGBTQIA+ communities in the last 30 years, and in the last year alone, we donated over $1.3 million.

Our efforts to support and advocate for LGBTQIA+ people do not start or end at Pride. By supporting our employees through global advocacy, charitable giving and better workplace practices, we hope to make a difference for LGBTQIA+ communities and beyond, as our drive for positive global impact continues and celebrates our employees and what brings them, and their communities’ joy.

At Microsoft, we continue to leverage our platform year-round to support and learn from LGBTQIA+ communities and address issues that impact the lived experience, safety, and fundamental rights of employees and their communities around the world.

We know that there is still work to be done, as a brand and as a global society. While we celebrate our successes, we remain committed to making continued progress.

Standing up for LGBTQIA+ equity since 1989

Microsoft introduced sexual orientation into our non-discrimination policies in 1989 – and we have been driving toward LGBTQIA+ inclusion ever since. In 1993, we began offering employee benefits for same-sex domestic partnerships, making us one of the first companies in the world to do so. We stood as a public supporter for marriage equality even before it became legal in the United States – and we continue to advocate for every type of family. Microsoft has attained a 100 score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index for 18 years. Since its founding in 1993, GLEAM (Global LGBTQIA+ Employees & Allies at Microsoft) has honored Pride by lifting up LGBTQIA+ voices and used the reach of our products to share the messages of inclusion and support.

We invite everyone to join us in the call for making more Pride. Share your thoughts with us on social by using #MicrosoftPride and #Pride.

Microsoft’s Datacenter Community Pledge: To build and operate digital infrastructure that addresses societal challenges and creates benefits for communities,"
		In the span of just one year, we’ve witnessed a remarkable acceleration in AI adoption, opening a new frontier of innovation, discovery and solutions. This surge in AI is not just about technological advancement; it’s about harnessing the potential to promote innovation, tackle some of societies’ largest challenges and change lives for the better. Microsoft’s role and responsibility as a leader in AI is reflected in the company’s commitment to ensure broad access to our technology that empowers organizations and individuals to serve the public good.
We build and operate a global network of advanced datacenters that enable this technology, and we recognize the crucial role that communities play in this ecosystem. We rely on a vast network of local suppliers, officials, stakeholders and residents to plan, design, construct and operate each of our facilities. To those communities, we owe a commitment to be responsible neighbors and contribute positively to local economies and ecosystems while advancing digital transformation. We recognize the importance of supporting communities, and our datacenters should be a resource that addresses local needs and priorities.
With that, I’m delighted to announce our Datacenter Community Pledge that builds upon the deep partnerships we have formed with communities around the world. This is our pledge that Microsoft’s datacenters will be not only the backbone of modern technology but also a force for good in the communities they serve.
The Datacenter Community Pledge focuses on three core areas:
Contributing to a sustainable future
We will design and operate our datacenters to support society’s climate goals and become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste before 2030.
Our sustainability work starts with taking accountability for our operational footprint. We remain unwavering in our commitment to achieve carbon negativity by 2030, and our datacenters play a pivotal role in this comprehensive decarbonization strategy.
By 2025, we will procure 100% renewable energy on a global scale, both significantly expanding and decarbonizing local electricity grids.
Our datacenter designs are more water efficient than traditional enterprise datacenters, and our plan by 2030 is to replenish more water than we consume locally.
Another critical aspect of our work is achieving zero waste. In 2020, we introduced the first of its kind Microsoft Circular Center in Amsterdam designed to reuse and repurpose servers and hardware in our datacenters. Since then, we have six operational Circular Centers in key locations that help us divert waste from landfills, and our plan by 2030 is to achieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting.
This pledge minimizes our dependency on local resources and ensures that our operations contribute positively to the community.

Progress on our commitment to sustainable backup power in datacenters by 2030 

Advancing community prosperity and well-being 
We will deliver significant local, economic, social and environmental benefits to the communities where we operate. 
Local people know their community better than anyone else, and that is why we partner with local stakeholders to ensure our datacenters provide support in the form of educational programs, grants and other initiatives aligned to local needs and priorities.
We partner with local governments, businesses, schools and nonprofits to create well-paid jobs and apprenticeship opportunities, and we provide essential digital skills training and STEM education for adults and children. Our goal is to empower community members with future-ready skills necessary for the digital age, ensuring they are prepared for the opportunities of tomorrow.
We invest in initiatives to enhance local sustainability. We restore sensitive watershed corridors and invest in projects to conserve trees, enhance native flora and protect ecological habitats, providing benefits to the surrounding ecosystems and honoring the natural beauty of the area.
Our datacenters generate public infrastructure improvements and tax revenue that serve as a catalyst for enhancing the quality of life in these areas. That translates into new and improved social services, such as parks where families can come together, better-equipped schools that empower children’s education and well-maintained roads and digital infrastructure that connect us all.

Operating responsibly as a good neighbor 
We will partner closely with communities and operate in a way that respects the local environment. 
In all we do, we strive to be a responsible neighbor. We listen, learn, build relationships and follow through on our commitments — guided by what is important locally. We will design our datacenters with the environment and communities in mind. From sustainable development practices and building materials to noise and light reduction measures, we will work with, and support, the environment and the communities where we are based.
We will collaborate with neighbors and communities throughout our development and operations, while partnering with nonprofits and suppliers who share our commitment to expand opportunities for all.

What’s next: Microsoft Build continues the evolution and expansion of AI tools for developers,"Groundbreaking advances in AI are having a profound impact on Microsoft and on the developers using our technology to improve efficiency, enhance customer experiences and make new breakthroughs.

Over the past year, we’ve built Microsoft Copilot and released more than 150 updates to it, and we’ve developed the Copilot stack, which takes everything we’ve learned so far and lets developers build their own copilots.

In addition, over the past two years, GitHub Copilot has become the most widely adopted AI developer tool, with 1.8 million paid subscribers.

And just a day ago, we introduced a new category of Copilot+ PCs, the fastest, most AI-ready PCs ever built.

We are the industry leader in AI, and that’s why, as we begin our flagship event for developers, Microsoft Build, there’s one question on everyone’s mind: What’s next?

On Monday, we introduced the world to a new class of Windows PCs, Copilot+ PCs. These devices are designed to allow developers to deliver differentiated AI experiences on the edge, and, together with the great features that we are announcing at Build, make Windows the most open platform for AI and the best place for developers.

At Build, we also are announcing further branches of this technology revolution, including:

How Microsoft Fabric is helping developers and customers leverage data in motion, or digital information being transported within or between computer systems, to build intelligent apps.
New frontier models that allow developers to explore multimodal capabilities supporting text, images, video and other types of data in their AI applications, evolving beyond text prompts and completions.
Partnerships that show how AI can impact the future of myriad industries, including education.
And how an open and flexible cloud-based platform, built on a foundation of safe and responsible AI, can help developers innovate.

Microsoft Build is always an exciting time for us. About 200,000 people have registered to join us for three days of technical learning and community connection, with 4,000 attending in person in Seattle. Attendees can choose from more than 300 sessions, demos and expert and instructor-led labs from Microsoft and our partners. For those not able to attend the live event, most content will be available on demand. In total, we are announcing about 60 new products and solutions at the event.

With that introduction to Build in mind, let’s explore some of the news and announcements.

In-the-moment decision making with Real-Time Intelligence

For the most efficient AI apps, businesses need to be able to qualify, analyze and organize data at ingestion. This has proven to be a difficult step. The new Real-Time Intelligence within Microsoft Fabric provides an end-to-end Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that empowers customers to act on high-volume, time-sensitive and highly granular data to make faster and more informed business decisions.

Real-Time Intelligence, now in preview, can be helpful for analysts with simple low/no-code experiences, and it also can benefit pro developers with code-rich user interfaces. For example, racing team Dener Motorsport has been using Microsoft Fabric to support real-time analytics, storage and reporting, enabling them to sustain optimal performance and maintain the cars in good repair, which can keep drivers safer. Dener plans to use Real-Time Intelligence as part of their winning strategy to gain insights at ingestion during races.

Building apps requires a level of flexibility, customization and efficiency to make it feasible for developers. The new Microsoft Fabric Workload Development Kit makes this possible by enabling independent software vendors (ISVs) and developers to extend applications within Fabric, creating a unified user experience.

GitHub Copilot experience leans into extensibility

GitHub is introducing the first set of GitHub Copilot extensions, developed by Microsoft and third-party partners, in private preview. These additions allow developers and organizations to customize their GitHub Copilot experience with their preferred services like Azure, Docker, Sentry and more directly within GitHub Copilot Chat.

GitHub Copilot for Azure, one of the extensions from Microsoft, showcases how building in natural language with a broader range of capabilities can propel development velocity. Using the extension through Copilot Chat, developers can explore and manage Azure resources, while also troubleshooting issues and locating relevant logs and code.

New frontier models and multimodal capabilities in Azure AI

GPT-4o, OpenAI’s newest flagship model, is now available in Azure AI Studio and as an API. This groundbreaking multimodal model integrates text, image and audio processing to set a new standard for generative and conversational AI experiences.

We also announced that Phi-3-vision, a new multimodal model in the Phi-3 family of AI small language models (SLMs) developed by Microsoft, is now available in Azure. Phi-3 models are powerful, cost-effective and optimized for personal devices. Phi-3-vision offers the ability to input images and text and receive text responses. For example, users can ask questions about a chart or ask an open-ended question about specific images.

Developers can experiment with these state-of-the-art frontier models in the Azure AI Playground, and they can start building with and customizing with the models in Azure AI Studio.

Microsoft, Khan Academy using AI to empower educators

Microsoft and Khan Academy are announcing a multi-faceted partnership to turn the transformative potential of AI into reality.

To start, Microsoft is enabling Khan Academy to offer all K-12 U.S. educators free access to Khanmigo for Teachers, an AI-powered teaching assistant that frees up teachers’ time so they can focus on what matters most – engaging with and supporting their students. Microsoft is donating access to Azure AI-optimized infrastructure to increase the availability of Khanmigo for Teachers, which will now be powered by Azure OpenAI Service.

Khan Academy is collaborating with Microsoft to explore opportunities to improve math tutoring in an affordable, scalable and adaptable manner with a new version of Phi-3, a family of SLMs developed by Microsoft. They also plan to bring more Khan Academy content into Copilot and Teams for Education, expanding resources for learners.

New partnership with Cognition AI

Microsoft and Cognition will bring Cognition’s autonomous AI software agent, Devin, to customers to help them with complex tasks such as code migration and modernization projects. As part of the agreement, Devin will be powered by Azure. Cognition AI is an applied AI lab building end-to-end software agents to help developers achieve more.

Powerful new virtual machines help fuel AI adoption

Microsoft has a unique systems approach to AI infrastructure, which includes hardware and software from Microsoft and our partners, all optimized to run AI workloads at scale and fine-tuned for customer needs. We are the first cloud provider to bring AMD’s leading MI300X AI accelerator chip to power customers’ AI training and inferencing needs, with the general availability of the Azure ND MI300X v5 virtual machine series optimized for demanding AI and high-performance computing (HPC) workloads like Azure OpenAI Service.

Following the launch of Azure Cobalt 100, Microsoft’s first custom-designed compute processor, the company is announcing a preview of new Cobalt 100 Arm-based virtual machines (VMs), based on the company’s custom silicon series announced in November 2023. Cobalt 100 Arm-based VMs are the first generation of VMs to feature Microsoft’s new Cobalt processor, custom-built on an Arm architecture, and optimized for efficiency and performance when running general-purpose and cloud-native workloads. Customers can expect up to 40% improved performance compared to comparable Azure VMs.

The evolution of Copilot

Copilot has been a game-changer for many people since it was first released. Using modern AI and large language models (LLMs) like Open AI’s GPT-4, copilots across Microsoft products have assisted people with complex tasks, serving as a personal, behind-the-scenes AI assistant.

Now, we are introducing Team Copilot, the expansion of Copilot for Microsoft 365 from a behind-the-scenes, personal AI assistant to a new, valuable member of your team. You will be able to invoke Copilot where you collaborate – in Teams, Loop, Planner and more. Team Copilot can be a meeting facilitator in meetings, managing the agenda, tracking time and taking notes. It can act as a collaborator in chats by surfacing important information, tracking action items and addressing unresolved issues. It can serve as a project manager to help ensure every project runs smoothly and notify the team when their input is needed. These initial experiences, coming in preview later this year, will enable us to learn, iterate and refine as we enter a new phase of innovation where Copilot begins to take more action on behalf of individuals and teams.

Microsoft Copilot Studio is introducing new agent capabilities, empowering developers to build copilots that can proactively respond to data and events, tailored to specific tasks and functions. Copilots built with this new category of capabilities can now independently manage complex, long-running business processes by leveraging memory and knowledge for context, reason over actions and inputs, learn based on user feedback and ask for help when they encounter situations that they don’t know how to handle. Users can now put Copilot to work for them – from IT device procurement to customer concierge for sales and service.

Copilot extensions, including plugins and connectors, allow customers to enhance Microsoft Copilot by connecting it to new data sources and applications, expanding its functionality.

We’re excited about these announcements and all the other updates and features being unveiled at Build. For more information, today you can watch keynotes from Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, Executive Vice President of Experiences and Devices Rajesh Jha and Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott.

On Wednesday, you can watch keynotes from Executive Vice President of Cloud and AI Scott Guthrie and friends. Additionally, you can explore all the news and announcements in the Book of News.

Introducing Copilot+ PCs,"
		An on-demand recording of our May 20 event is available.
Today, at a special event on our new Microsoft campus, we introduced the world to a new category of Windows PCs designed for AI, Copilot+ PCs.   
Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built. With powerful new silicon capable of an incredible 40+ TOPS (trillion operations per second), all–day battery life and access to the most advanced AI models, Copilot+ PCs will enable you to do things you can’t on any other PC. Easily find and remember what you have seen in your PC with Recall, generate and refine AI images in near real-time directly on the device using Cocreator, and bridge language barriers with Live Captions, translating audio from 40+ languages into English.  
These experiences come to life on a set of thin, light and beautiful devices from Microsoft Surface and our OEM partners Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo and Samsung, with pre-orders beginning today and availability starting on June 18. Starting at $999, Copilot+ PCs offer incredible value. 
This first wave of Copilot+ PCs is just the beginning. Over the past year, we have seen an incredible pace of innovation of AI in the cloud with Copilot allowing us to do things that we never dreamed possible. Now, we begin a new chapter with AI innovation on the device. We have completely reimagined the entirety of the PC – from silicon to the operating system, the application layer to the cloud – with AI at the center, marking the most significant change to the Windows platform in decades.

The fastest, most secure Windows PCs ever built 
We introduced an all-new system architecture to bring the power of the CPU, GPU, and now a new high performance Neural Processing Unit (NPU) together. Connected to and enhanced by the large language models (LLMs) running in our Azure Cloud in concert with small language models (SLMs), Copilot+ PCs can now achieve a level of performance never seen before. They are up to 20x more powerful[1] and up to 100x as efficient[2] for running AI workloads and deliver industry-leading AI acceleration. They outperform Apple’s MacBook Air 15” by up to 58% in sustained multithreaded performance[3], all while delivering all-day battery life.  With incredible efficiency, Copilot+ PCs can deliver up to 22 hours of local video playback or 15 hours of web browsing on a single charge.[4] That is up to 20% more battery in local video playback than the MacBook Air 15”.[5]
Windows now has the best implementation of apps on the fastest chip, starting with Qualcomm. We now offer more native Arm64 experiences than ever before, including our fastest implementation of Microsoft 365 apps like Teams, PowerPoint, Outlook, Word, Excel, OneDrive and OneNote. Chrome, Spotify, Zoom, WhatsApp, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, Blender, Affinity Suite, DaVinci Resolve and many more now run​ natively on Arm to give you great performance with additional apps, like Slack, releasing later this year. In fact, 87% of the total app minutes people spend in apps today have native Arm versions.[6] With a powerful new emulator, Prism, your apps run great, whether native or emulated.
Every Copilot+ PC comes secured out of the box. The Microsoft Pluton Security processor will be enabled by default on all Copilot+ PCs and we have introduced a number of new features, updates and defaults to Windows 11 that make it easy for users to stay secure. And, we’ve built in personalized privacy controls to help you protect what’s important to you. You can read more about how we are making Windows more secure here.
Entirely new, powerful AI experiences  
Copilot+ PCs leverage powerful processors and multiple state-of-the-art AI models, including several of Microsoft’s world-class SLMs, to unlock a new set of experiences you can run locally, directly on the device. This removes previous limitations on things like latency, cost and even privacy to help you be more productive, creative and communicate more effectively. 
Recall instantly 
We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we encounter daily – finding something we know we have seen before on our PC. Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored in, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails trying to find it.  
Now with Recall, in preview starting June 18, you can access virtually what you have seen or done on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic memory. Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do – based on relationships and associations unique to each of our individual experiences. This helps you remember things you may have forgotten so you can find what you’re looking for quickly and intuitively by simply using the cues you remember. [7]

You can scroll across time to find the content you need in your timeline across any application, website, document, or more. Interact intuitively using snapshots with screenray to help you take the next step using suggested actions based on object recognition. And get back to where you were, whether to a specific email in Outlook or the right chat in Teams.
Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored entirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay locally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust and delete ranges of time in Settings, or pause at any point right from the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar. You can also filter apps and websites from ever being saved. You are always in control with privacy you can trust.
Cocreate with AI-powered image creation and editing, built into Windows
Since the launch of Image Creator, almost 10 billion images have been generated, helping more people bring their ideas to life easily by using natural language to describe what they want to create. Yet, today’s cloud offerings may limit the number of images you can create, keep you waiting while the artwork processes or even present privacy concerns. By using the Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and powerful local small language models, we are bringing innovative new experiences to your favorite creative applications like Paint and Photos.

Microsoft and LinkedIn release the 2024 Work Trend Index on the state of AI at work,"
		One year ago, generative AI burst onto the scene and for the first time since the smartphone, people began to change the way they interact with technology. People are bringing AI to work at an unexpected scale — and now the big question is, how’s it going?
As AI becomes ubiquitous in the workplace, employees and businesses alike are under extreme pressure. The pace and intensity of work, which accelerated during the pandemic, has not eased, so employees are bringing their own AI to work. Leaders agree AI is a business imperative — and feel the pressure to show immediate ROI — but many lack a plan and vision to go from individual impact to applying AI to drive the bottom line.
At the same time, the labor market is set to shift and there’s a new AI economy. While some professionals worry AI will replace their job, the data tells a more nuanced story — of a hidden talent shortage, more employees eyeing a career change, and a massive opportunity for those willing to skill up.
“AI is democratizing expertise across the workforce,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Microsoft. “Our latest research highlights the opportunity for every organization to apply this technology to drive better decision-making, collaboration — and ultimately business outcomes.”
For our fourth annual Work Trend Index, out today, we partnered with LinkedIn for the first time on a joint report so we could provide a comprehensive view of how AI is not only reshaping work, but the labor market more broadly. We surveyed 31,000 people across 31 countries, identified labor and hiring trends from LinkedIn, analyzed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals and conducted research with Fortune 500 customers. The data points to insights every leader and professional needs to know — and actions they can take — when it comes to AI’s implications for work.
1. Employees want AI at work — and won’t wait for companies to catch up.
Three in four knowledge workers (75%) now use AI at work. Employees, overwhelmed and under duress, say AI saves time, boosts creativity and allows them to focus on their most important work. While 79% of leaders agree AI adoption is critical to remain competitive, 59% worry about quantifying the productivity gains of AI and 60% worry their company lacks a vision and plan to implement it. While leaders feel the pressure to turn individual productivity gains into organizational impact, employees aren’t waiting to reap the benefits: 78% of AI users are bringing their own AI tools to work. The opportunity for every leader is to channel this momentum into ROI.
2. For employees, AI raises the bar and breaks the career ceiling.
We also see AI beginning to impact the job market. While AI and job loss are top of mind for some, our data shows more people are eyeing a career change, there are jobs available, and employees with AI skills will get first pick. The majority of leaders (55%) say they’re worried about having enough talent to fill open roles this year, with leaders in cybersecurity, engineering, and creative design feeling the pinch most.
And professionals are looking. Forty-six percent across the globe are considering quitting in the year ahead — an all-time high since the Great Reshuffle of 2021 — a separate LinkedIn study found U.S. numbers to be even higher with 85% eyeing career moves. While two-thirds of leaders wouldn’t hire someone without AI skills, only 39% of users have received AI training from their company. So, professionals are skilling up on their own. As of late last year, we’ve seen a 142x increase in LinkedIn members adding AI skills like Copilot and ChatGPT to their profiles and a 160% increase in non-technical professionals using LinkedIn Learning courses to build their AI aptitude.
In a world where AI mentions in LinkedIn job posts drive a 17% bump in application growth, it’s a two-way street: Organizations that empower employees with AI tools and training will attract the best talent, and professionals who skill up will have the edge.
3. The rise of the AI power user — and what they reveal about the future.
In the research, four types of AI users emerged on a spectrum — from skeptics who rarely use AI to power users who use it extensively. Compared to skeptics, AI power users have reoriented their workdays in fundamental ways, reimagining business processes and saving over 30 minutes per day. Over 90% of power users say AI makes their overwhelming workload more manageable and their work more enjoyable, but they aren’t doing it on their own.
Power users work for a different kind of company. They are 61% more likely to have heard from their CEO on the importance of using generative AI at work, 53% more likely to receive encouragement from leadership to consider how AI can transform their function and 35% more likely to receive tailored AI training for their specific role or function.
“AI is redefining work and it’s clear we need new playbooks,” said Ryan Roslansky, CEO of LinkedIn. “It’s the leaders who build for agility instead of stability and invest in skill building internally that will give their organizations a competitive advantage and create more efficient, engaged and equitable teams.”
The prompt box is the new blank page 
We hear one consistent piece of feedback from our customers: talking to AI is harder than it seems. We’ve all learned how to use a search engine, identifying the right few words to get the best results. AI requires more context — just like when you delegate work to a direct report or colleague. But for many, staring down that empty prompt box feels like facing a blank page: Where should I even start?
Today, we’re announcing Copilot for Microsoft 365 innovations to help our customers answer that question.

If you’ve got the start of a prompt, Copilot will offer to auto-complete it to get to a better result, suggesting something more detailed to help ensure you get what you’re looking for. That not only speeds things up, it offers you new ideas for how to leverage Copilot’s power.

Other times, you know exactly what you want — you’re just not sure how to ask. With its new rewrite feature, Copilot turns a basic prompt into a rich one with the click of a button, turning everyone into a prompt engineer.

Catch Up, a new chat interface that surfaces personal insights based on your recent activity, provides responsive recommendations, like “You have a meeting with the sales VP on Thursday. Let’s get you prepared — click here to get detailed notes.”
We also know that every role, team and function has unique needs and ways of working. To help create prompts for exactly the work you do, you’ll soon be able to create, publish and manage prompts in Copilot Lab that are expressly tailored to your closest teams.

These features will be available in the coming months, and in the future, we’ll take it a step further, with Copilot asking you questions to get to your best work yet.
LinkedIn has also made free over 50 learning courses to empower professionals at all levels to advance their AI aptitude.
Head to WorkLab for the full Work Trend Index Report, and head to LinkedIn to hear more from LinkedIn’s Chief Economist, Karin Kimbrough, on how AI is reshaping the labor market.

Prioritizing security above all else,"Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, shared the below communication with Microsoft employees. In light of the significant attention and discussion this announcement has garnered, it has been made publicly available as an official record.

Today, I want to talk about something critical to our company’s future: prioritizing security above all else.

Microsoft runs on trust, and our success depends on earning and maintaining it. We have a unique opportunity and responsibility to build the most secure and trusted platform that the world innovates upon.

The recent findings by the Department of Homeland Security’s Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB) regarding the Storm-0558 cyberattack, from summer 2023, underscore the severity of the threats facing our company and our customers, as well as our responsibility to defend against these increasingly sophisticated threat actors.

Last November, we launched our Secure Future Initiative (SFI) with this responsibility in mind, bringing together every part of the company to advance cybersecurity protection across both new products and legacy infrastructure. I’m proud of this initiative, and grateful for the work that has gone into implementing it. But we must and will do more.

Going forward, we will commit the entirety of our organization to SFI, as we double down on this initiative with an approach grounded in three core principles:

Secure by Design: Security comes first when designing any product or service.
Secure by Default: Security protections are enabled and enforced by default, require no extra effort, and are not optional.
Secure Operations: Security controls and monitoring will continuously be improved to meet current and future threats.

These principles will govern every facet of our SFI pillars as we: Protect Identities and Secrets, Protect Tenants and Isolate Production Systems, Protect Networks, Protect Engineering Systems, Monitor and Detect Threats, and Accelerate Response and Remediation. We’ve shared specific, company-wide actions each of these pillars will entail — including those recommended in the CSRB’s report — which you can learn about here. Across Microsoft, we will mobilize to implement and operationalize these standards, guidelines, and requirements and this will be an added dimension of our hiring and rewards decisions. In addition, we will instill accountability by basing part of the compensation of the senior leadership team on our progress towards meeting our security plans and milestones.

We must approach this challenge with both technical and operational rigor, and with a focus on continuous improvement. Every task we take on – from a line of code, to a customer or partner process – is an opportunity to help bolster our own security and that of our entire ecosystem. This includes learning from our adversaries and the increasing sophistication of their capabilities, as we did with Midnight Blizzard. And learning from the trillions of unique signals we’re constantly monitoring to strengthen our overall posture. It also includes stronger, more structured collaboration across the public and private sector.

Security is a team sport, and accelerating SFI isn’t just job number one for our security teams – it’s everyone’s top priority and our customers’ greatest need.

If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security. In some cases, this will mean prioritizing security above other things we do, such as releasing new features or providing ongoing support for legacy systems. This is key to advancing both our platform quality and capability such that we can protect the digital estates of our customers and build a safer world for all.

Satya"

We are also building on our relationship with Cloud Software Group to bring joint cloud solutions and generative AI capabilities to more than 100 million people.

We continue to shape the future of industry alongside our customers to help them differentiate their businesses. At CES, we showcased how our customers and partners are innovating across the automotive and mobility industry with generative AI to solve deep business problems and create new opportunities, and revealed the Copilot key for Windows 11 PCs. At NRF, we shared new copilot templates to help retailers incorporate generative AI across the shopper journey while enhancing the experience for store associates and making AI implementation more accessible. Just recently at HIMSS, we announced Microsoft’s role as the technology enabling partner for the Trustworthy & Responsible AI Network, a consortium of healthcare leaders aimed at operationalizing responsible AI principles to improve the quality, safety and trustworthiness of AI in healthcare.

Manufacturing for tomorrow: Microsoft announces new industrial AI innovations from the cloud to the factory floor,"After years of uncertainty from supply chain disruption and increased customer expectations, to changes in consumer demand and workforce shortages, manufacturing remains one of the most resilient and complex industries. Today, we are witnessing the manufacturing industry enter a transformative era, fueled by AI and new AI-powered industrial solutions. This AI-driven shift is prompting many organizations to fundamentally alter their business models and re-evaluate how to address industry-wide challenges like data siloes from disparate data estates and legacy products, supply chain visibility issues, labor shortages, and the need for upskilling employees, among others.  AI is more than just an automation tool, it’s a catalyst for innovation, efficiency and sustainability. AI innovation creates an opportunity to help manufacturers enhance time-to-value, bolster operations resilience, optimize factory and production costs and produce repeatable outcomes.

Ahead of Hannover Messe, one of the world’s largest manufacturing innovation events, Microsoft is announcing new AI and data solutions for manufacturers to help unlock innovation, enable intelligent factories, optimize operations and enhance employee productivity. The manufacturing industry has been incredibly resilient over the last decade and the infusion of new AI solutions signifies a critical transformation in this vital industry.

Unlock innovation and fuel the next generation of intelligent factories with data and AI

Manufacturing is one of the most data-intensive industries, generating an average of 1.9 petabytes worldwide every year, according to McKinsey Global Institute. And most of this data goes unused, leaving many valuable insights untapped. According to Gartner® Research, “Generative AI will transform the manufacturing industry to a level previously not available, by providing new insights and recommendations based on data and actionable information.”[1] In this era of AI, the importance of data continues to grow as organizations realize they are only scratching the surface of what’s possible.

To help customers leverage their data and insights, today, we are announcing the private preview of manufacturing data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, and copilot template for factory operations on Azure AI. These solutions help manufacturers unify their operational technology and information technology (IT) data estate and accelerate and scale data transformation for AI in Fabric, our end-to-end analytics SaaS-based platform. Copilot template for factory operations helps manufacturers to create their own copilots for front-line workers utilizing the unified data. Front-line employees can use natural language to query the data for knowledge discovery, training, issue resolution, asset maintenance and more. For example, if a factory plant manager wants to understand why a machine is breaking, they can query the copilot to get insights and resolve the issue in just days, instead of weeks.

As part of our private preview, Intertape Polymer Group (IPG) uses Sight Machine’s Manufacturing Data Platform to continuously transform data generated by its factory equipment into a robust data foundation for analyzing and modeling its machines, production processes and finished products. IPG is now using Sight Machine’s Factory CoPilot, a generative AI platform with an intuitive natural language chat interface, powered by the Microsoft Cloud for Manufacturing and the copilot template for factory operations on Azure AI. This tool facilitates the team’s ability to rapidly gather insights and direct work on production lines which previously operated like black boxes. Instead of working through manual spreadsheets and inaccessible data, all teammates including production, engineering, procurement and finance have better information to drive decisions on products and processes throughout the plant improving yield and reducing inventory levels.

Also in private preview, Bridgestone is partnering with Avanade to confront production challenges head-on, focusing on critical issues related to production disruptions and scheduling inefficiencies, like yield loss, which can escalate into quality issues. As a private preview customer collaborating with Avanade, Bridgestone aims to harness the power of manufacturing data solutions in Fabric and the copilot template for factory operations. Their goal is to implement a natural language query system that enables front-line workers, with different levels of experience, with insights that lead to faster issue resolution. The team is excited to establish a centralized system that efficiently gathers and presents critical information from various sources and facilitates informed decision-making and enhances  operational agility across Bridgestone’s production ecosystem.

Creating more resilient operations and supply chains

A robust data strategy must span from cloud to the shop floor to enable the level of scale and integration that will help manufacturers accelerate industrial transformation across all operations. However, gathering OT data and integrating the data into multiple solutions is not an easy task for manufacturers. Production is complex, and their sensors, machines and systems are highly varied. Each site is unique and ensuring the right data is being shared with the right person at the right time is onerous and costly. Unfortunately, these scale and integration hurdles also block the enterprise from scaling AI solutions across every shop floor or gaining global visibility across all their sites.

With this in mind, Microsoft recently launched the adaptive cloud approach, including Azure IoT Operations. Our adaptive cloud is a framework to modernize edge infrastructure across operations, like factories, to take advantage of a modern, composable and connected architecture for your applications. Our adaptive cloud approach creates the level of scale needed to repeat AI solutions across production lines and sites. Putting the adaptive cloud approach into practice, Azure IoT Operations leverages open standards and works with Microsoft Fabric to create a common data foundation for IT and OT collaboration. To find out more about our adaptive cloud approach and Azure IoT Operations, visit our Azure Blog.

Looking to increase global operational efficiency, Microsoft’s customer Electrolux Group, developed a single platform to build, deploy and manage several key manufacturing use cases. Their platform’s goal is to capture all manufacturing data, contextualize it and make it available for real time decision-making across all levels of the organization within a scalable infrastructure. To enable this, Electrolux Group is adopting a full stack solution from Microsoft that leverages the adaptive cloud approach, including Azure IoT Operations. Using this approach, Electrolux Group is looking to reduce overhead from multiple vendors, a consistent and simple way to deploy and manage multiple use cases at a site, and then the ability to scale those solutions to multiple sites with simple and consistent fleet management.

Supply chain disruption is not new; however, its complexity and the rate of change are outpacing organizations’ ability to address issues. Manufacturers are under pressure to prevent and minimize disruptions, and as a result, almost 90% of supply chain professionals plan to invest in ways to make their supply chains more resilient. To support our customers, we’re announcing the upcoming preview of a traceability add-in for Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management that will allow businesses to increase visibility into their product genealogy through the different steps of the supply chain. Traceability will also help businesses track events and attributes throughout supply chain processes and will provide an interface to query and analyze data.

Empowering front-line workers with AI tools to improve productivity and job satisfaction

To enable intelligent factory operations, an empowered and connected workforce is key. According to the latest Work Trend Index, 63% of front-line workers do repetitive or menial tasks that take time away from more meaningful work. Additionally, 80% of front-line workers think AI will augment their ability to find the right information and the answers they need. From the office to the factory floor to the field, we are building solutions to address the unique challenges manufacturers face — by helping streamline front-line operations, enhance communication and collaboration, improve employee experience and strengthen security across shared devices.

Today we’re introducing new capabilities for Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service that help service managers and technicians efficiently find information, resolve issues while keeping customers updated at every step, and help summarize their work. Generally available, field service managers can interact with Copilot to find pertinent information about work orders using natural language in their flow of work in the Dynamics 365 Field Service web app. Additionally, available in public preview, front-line workers can configure and customize the fields Copilot uses to generate summaries within Dynamics 365 Field Service.

To further streamline collaboration among field service managers, technicians, and remote experts, Dynamics 365 Field Service users with the Field Service app in Teams can now share links to work orders that automatically expand to provide key details. This capability is generally available starting today. Should technicians need additional assistance from remote experts to resolve issues, they can simply access Dynamics 365 Remote Assist capabilities in the flow of work in Microsoft Teams with anchored spatial annotations even if the camera moves.

Advancing science: Microsoft and Quantinuum demonstrate the most reliable logical qubits on record with an error rate 800x better than physical qubits,"
		Quantinuum scientists making adjustments to a beam line array used to deliver laser pulses in H-Series quantum computers. Photo courtesy of Quantinuum.
Today signifies a major achievement for the entire quantum ecosystem: Microsoft and Quantinuum demonstrated the most reliable logical qubits on record. By applying Microsoft’s breakthrough qubit-virtualization system, with error diagnostics and correction, to Quantinuum’s ion-trap hardware, we ran more than 14,000 individual experiments without a single error. Furthermore, we demonstrated more reliable quantum computation by performing error diagnostics and corrections on logical qubits without destroying them. This finally moves us out of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) level to Level 2 Resilient quantum computing.
This is a crucial milestone on our path to building a hybrid supercomputing system that can transform research and innovation across many industries. It is made possible by the collective advancement of quantum hardware, qubit virtualization and correction, and hybrid applications that take advantage of the best of AI, supercomputing, and quantum capabilities. With a hybrid supercomputer powered by 100 reliable logical qubits, organizations would start to see scientific advantage, while scaling closer to 1,000 reliable logical qubits would unlock commercial advantage.
Advanced capabilities based on these logical qubits will be available in private preview for Azure Quantum Elements customers in the coming months.

A purpose-built computing platform for science
Many of the hardest problems facing society, such as reversing climate change, addressing food insecurity and solving the energy crisis, are chemistry and materials science problems. However, the number of possible stable molecules and materials may surpass the number of atoms in the observable universe. Even a billion years of classical computing would be insufficient to explore and evaluate them all.
That’s why the promise of quantum is so appealing. Scaled quantum computers would offer the ability to simulate the interactions of molecules and atoms at the quantum level beyond the reach of classical computers, unlocking solutions that can be a catalyst for positive change in our world. But quantum computing is just one layer for driving these breakthrough insights.
Whether it’s to supercharge pharma productivity or pioneer the next sustainable battery, accelerating scientific discovery requires a purpose-built, hybrid compute platform. Researchers need access to the right tool at the right stage of their discovery pipeline to efficiently solve every layer of their scientific problem and drive insights into where they matter most. This is what we built with Azure Quantum Elements, empowering organizations to transform research and development with capabilities including screening massive data sets with AI, narrowing down options with high-performance computing (HPC) or improving model accuracy with the power of scaled quantum computing in the future.
We continue to advance the state-of-the-art across all these hybrid technologies for our customers, with today’s quantum milestone laying the foundation for useful, reliable and scalable simulations of quantum mechanics.
Moving toward resilience 
In an article I wrote on LinkedIn, I used a ‘leaky boat’ analogy to explain why fidelity and error correction are so important to quantum computing. In short, fidelity is the value we use to measure how reliably a quantum computer can produce a meaningful result. Only with good fidelity will we have a solid foundation to reliably scale a quantum machine that can solve practical, real-world problems.
For years, one approach used to fix this leaky boat has been to increase the number of noisy physical qubits together with techniques to compensate for that noise but falling short of real logical qubits with superior error correction rates.  The main shortcoming of most of today’s NISQ machines is that the physical qubits are too noisy and error-prone to make robust quantum error correction possible. Our industry’s foundational components are not good enough for quantum error correction to work, and it’s why even larger NISQ systems are not practical for real-world applications.
The task at hand for the entire quantum ecosystem is to increase the fidelity of qubits and enable fault-tolerant quantum computing so that we can use a quantum machine to unlock solutions to previously intractable problems. In short, we need to transition to reliable logical qubits — created by combining multiple physical qubits together into logical ones to protect against noise and sustain a long (i.e., resilient) computation. We can only obtain this with careful hardware and software co-design. By having high-quality hardware components and breakthrough error-handling capabilities designed for that machine, we can get better results than any individual component could give us. Today, we’ve done just that.
“Breakthroughs in quantum error correction and fault tolerance are important for realizing the long-term value of quantum computing for scientific discovery and energy security. Results like these enable continued development of quantum computing systems for research and development.”
Dr. Travis Humble, Director, Quantum Science Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory
A breakthrough for handling quantum errors 
That’s why today is such a historic moment: for the first time on record as an industry, we’re advancing from Level 1 Foundational to Level 2 Resilient quantum computing. We’re now entering the next phase for solving meaningful problems with reliable quantum computers. Our qubit-virtualization system, which filters and corrects errors, combined with Quantinuum’s hardware demonstrates the largest gap between physical and logical error rates reported to date. This is the first demonstrated system with four logical qubits that improves the logical over the physical error rate by such a large order of magnitude.
We’ve been able to demonstrate the largest gap between physical and logical error rates yet detected — far below the break-even point, now within a regime where quantum error correction is valuable and works.
As importantly, we’re also now able to diagnose and correct errors in the logical qubits without destroying them — referred to as “active syndrome extraction.” This represents a huge step forward for the industry as it enables more reliable quantum computation.
With this system, we ran more than 14,000 individual experiments without a single error. You can read more about these results here.
“Quantum error correction often seems very theoretical. What’s striking here is the massive contribution Microsoft’s midstack software for qubit optimization is making to the improved step-down in error rates. Microsoft really is putting theory into practice.”
Dr. David Shaw, Chief Analyst, Global Quantum Intelligence
A long-standing collaboration with Quantinuum
Since 2019, Microsoft has been collaborating with Quantinuum to enable quantum developers to write and run their own quantum code on ion-trap qubit technology which includes high-fidelity, full connectivity and mid-circuit measurements. Multiple published benchmark tests recognize Quantinuum as having the best quantum volumes, making them well-positioned to enter Level 2.
“Today’s results mark a historic achievement and are a wonderful reflection of how this collaboration continues to push the boundaries for the quantum ecosystem. With Microsoft’s state-of-the-art error correction aligned with the world’s most powerful quantum computer and a fully integrated approach, we are so excited for the next evolution in quantum applications and can’t wait to see how our customers and partners will benefit from our solutions especially as we move towards quantum processors at scale.”
Ilyas Khan, Founder and Chief Product Officer, Quantinuum
Quantinuum’s hardware performs at physical two-qubit fidelity of 99.8%. This fidelity enables application of our qubit-virtualization system, with diagnostics and error correction, and makes today’s announcement possible. This quantum system, with co-innovation from Microsoft and Quantinuum, ushers us into Level 2 Resilient.
Pioneering quantum supercomputing, together
At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every individual and organization to achieve more. We’ve brought the world’s best NISQ hardware to the cloud with our Azure Quantum platform so our customers can embark on their quantum journey. This is why we’ve integrated artificial intelligence with quantum computing and cloud HPC in the private preview of Azure Quantum Elements. We used this platform to design and demonstrate an end-to-end workflow that integrates Copilot, Azure compute and a quantum algorithm running on Quantinuum processors to train an AI model for property prediction.
Today’s announcement continues this commitment by advancing quantum hardware to Level 2. Advanced capabilities based on these logical qubits will be available in private preview for Azure Quantum Elements in the coming months.
Lastly, we continue to invest heavily in progressing beyond Level 2, scaling to the level of quantum supercomputing. This is why we’ve been advocating for our topological approach, the feasibility of which our Azure Quantum team has demonstrated. At Level 3, we expect to be able to solve some of our most challenging problems, particularly in fields like chemistry and materials science, unlocking new applications that bring quantum at scale together with the best of classical supercomputing and AI — all connected in the Azure Quantum cloud.
We are excited to empower the collective genius and make these breakthroughs accessible to our customers. For more details on how we achieved today’s results, explore our technical blog, and register for the upcoming Quantum Innovator Series with Quantinuum.

Sustainable by design: Advancing the sustainability of AI,"During the past year, the pace of AI adoption has accelerated significantly, ushering in groundbreaking advances, discoveries and solutions with the potential to help address humanity’s biggest problems. We see this as a massive platform shift, akin to the printing press, which was not just an invention, but a technology that shaped a new economy. Alongside the incredible promise and benefits of AI, we recognize the resource intensity of these applications and the need to address the environmental impact from every angle.

In line with our commitment to responsible AI and our ambitious sustainability commitments, we’re determined to tackle this challenge so the world can harness the full benefits of AI. There are three areas where we’re deeply invested and increasing our focus. The first is optimizing datacenter energy and water efficiency. The second is advancing low-carbon materials, creating global markets to help advance sustainability across industries. And the third is improving the energy efficiency of AI and cloud services, empowering our customers and partners with tools for collective progress.

1. Optimizing datacenter energy and water efficiency

Over the past decade, our quest to innovate across every part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver more sustainable cloud services has led to many changes across how we design, build and operate our datacenters. As we continue this work, two of the biggest challenges we’re addressing are energy management and water intensity.

Energy management

The energy intensity of advanced cloud and AI services has driven us to accelerate our efforts to drive efficiencies and energy reductions. In addition, we have expanded our support to grow the availability of renewable energy, both for our own operations and for the communities in which we operate.

To continue driving improvements in datacenter energy management, we work to reduce peak power, safely harvest unused power, increase server density in existing datacenters through intelligent utilization and power-aware virtual machine allocation, and drive efficiency all the way to our chips and code.

With recognition of the need to continue bringing more renewable energy online, we currently have more than 135 renewables projects in our power purchase agreement (PPA) portfolio globally, a powerful mechanism to support the global energy transition. In the way we design, build and operate our datacenters, we’re focused on the path to 100% zero-carbon electricity 100% of the time.

We’re also working on solutions that enable datacenters to provide energy back to the grid to contribute to local energy supply during times of high demand. For example, in Ireland we built batteries into wind turbines for a wind energy project to capture energy when the turbines over-perform and deliver that energy to the local grid. In Denmark, excess heat created in a Microsoft datacenter will provide heat to the local community, producing enough heat to warm around 6,000 local homes. Both are examples of our work to use our data centers as a source of electricity to relieve pressure on local electric grids.

Water intensity

Currently, many datacenters rely on water for two reasons: directly for cooling, and indirectly for electricity generation. Although at a global scale total water consumption by datacenters is relatively small, weighing in about 0.1% of national water use in the U.S.1 we recognize the impact of datacenter operations on water-stressed areas, and are working to reduce this impact and design solutions that advance our progress on the road to water positive.

We take a holistic approach to water reduction across our business, from design to efficiency, looking for immediate opportunities through operational usage and, in the longer term, through design innovation to reduce, recycle and repurpose water. We’ve found success in using direct air instead of water to cool datacenters, harvesting rainwater, and procuring reclaimed water from utilities to reduce our dependence on fresh water. For example, in our Sweden datacenters, we will use a process called free cooling, a simple, cost-effective method that results in a 30% reduction in energy costs and 90% less water usage than standard systems.

2. Advancing low-carbon materials

For our future datacenters and to help drive progress industry-wide, another way we can advance progress is by helping to accelerate markets for low-carbon building materials. As a sector, building materials such as steel and cement are currently some of the highest contributors to the carbon cost of new construction, together producing an estimated 13.5% of global carbon emissions.2

Innovations in green steel3 and lower-carbon cement are rapidly emerging, however, these markets are still nascent and need significant investment to scale up and bring supply online.

With our $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund, we’re investing to hasten the development and deployment of new climate innovations, especially for underfunded sectors and supply-constrained markets like lower-carbon building materials. For example, we are investing in solutions such as H2 Green Steel to expand market supply of near-zero carbon steel4 which can deliver up to 95% lower CO2 emissions than conventional steel. We are also evaluating use of near-zero carbon steel in our own building materials and equipment supply chains.

Similarly, we’re working to broaden availability of low-carbon concrete and other construction materials through commercial projects and collaboration with the largest datacenter companies in the world. In Washington state, our pilot program utilizes concrete alternatives like biogenic limestone and fly ash and slag with the goal of lowering the embodied carbon in concrete by more than 50% compared to traditional concrete mixes. With these investments, we aim to facilitate the commercialization of materials that can make an outsized impact on carbon reduction, for our own construction and the broader industry.

3. Improving energy efficiency of AI and cloud services

Reducing the energy needed to power AI and cloud services up front is another critical component of the solution. We’re working to support developers and IT professionals with tools to optimize models and code, exploring ways to reduce the energy requirements of AI, and harnessing the power of these advanced technologies to drive energy breakthroughs.

As a founding member of the Green Software Foundation, we collaborate with other industry-leading organizations to help grow the field of green software engineering, contribute to standards for the industry and work together to reduce the carbon emissions of software. Across our cloud services, we’re working to ensure IT professionals have the information they need to better understand and reduce the carbon emissions associated with their cloud usage.

As AI scenarios increase in complexity, we’re empowering developers to build and optimize AI models that can achieve similar outcomes while requiring fewer resources. Over the past few months, we’ve released a suite of small language models (SLMs) called “Phi” that achieve remarkable performance on a variety of benchmarks, matching or outperforming models up to 25x larger. Now available in the Azure AI Studio model catalog, Phi-2 offers a compact model for research and development or fine-tuning experimentation on a variety of tasks.

We’ve learned that the complex sustainability challenges we face today are best addressed through multidisciplinary, multi-sector collaboration, and energy breakthroughs are no exception. We recently collaborated with the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) using advanced AI models to find new materials that can reduce reliance on traditional battery materials such as lithium. The team screened over 32 million materials, discovered 500,000 stable candidates, and synthesized one promising candidate to a working prototype, shortening a process that can take years to a matter of days.

These highlights provide a glimpse into our work to build and operate cloud services more sustainably, advancing solutions that can reduce the future impact of AI. Our ambitious 2030 targets to become carbon negative, water positive, zero waste and to protect biodiversity require continued innovation across every aspect of our operations, and we’re committed to sharing what we learn along the way. Stay tuned for more on this topic in the months ahead.

From vision to reality: Microsoft’s partners embrace AI to deliver customer value,"Artificial intelligence is a defining technology of our time. Over the past year we’ve begun to see how it can unlock profound possibilities for individuals, organizations and society — and it’s clear that we have only scratched the surface.  

For Microsoft and our partners across industries, AI offers a generational moment to reimagine the capabilities that software and services can provide. Our goal at Microsoft is to innovate and democratize our breakthroughs in AI — and the opportunity for partners is far greater than the sum of AI technologies themselves.  

For this State of the Partner Ecosystem moment, we’ll share how partners are seizing the opportunities that AI offers and making its promise real for organizations across the world. We’ll highlight partners who are building AI-powered solutions to innovate across industries, including three partners who are: 

Helping people and organizations achieve, in months, what once might have been a multi-year endeavor. 
Innovating in higher education by streamlining work in marketing, admissions and student advising. 
Empowering real-time decision making at the point of impact across the supply chain. 

First, we’ll look at how Microsoft is empowering our partners to innovate, build and differentiate with AI through a combination of technology advancements, an industry leading partner program and true market differentiation. During this time of AI transformation, there has never been a greater time to be a Microsoft partner, and our partners are fully embracing this new opportunity.

From vision to value realization: A closer look at how customers are embracing AI Transformation to unlock innovation and deliver business outcomes,"Each quarter, I share a collection of customer and partner stories from around the world that highlight the incredible technological advancements shaping the future of industry. As a partner of choice, we are committed to helping organizations accelerate AI Transformation to unlock opportunities and realize material business value. Our ability to bend the curve on AI innovation is allowing us to live truer to our mission than ever before: to empower our customers and partners to achieve more.

I am sharing an additional blog this quarter because we are seeing so much inspiring AI Transformation and pragmatic innovation with our customers. Their impressive results are benefiting employees, businesses, and industry, and I would like to expand on a handful of stories that crystallize the tangible impact AI is having on organizations that embrace it:

Digital financial services firm Ally Financial is leveraging Microsoft Azure and Azure OpenAI Service to reduce manual tasks for its customer service associates, freeing up time for them to reinvent how they engage with customers. Previously, associates needed to take notes and write summaries after every call, which competed with the amount of time and attention they could give to their customers. By using generative AI to automate manual tasks, Ally empowered its associates to deliver a better, more personal experience while protecting vital customer data through a production-ready solution in only eight weeks. The new solution has cut associates’ post-call effort by 30% while capturing critical information automatically with over 85% accuracy — even finding details they may have previously missed in their conversations.

Global travel technology provider Amadeus deployed Copilot for Microsoft 365 to help empower its workforce, beginning with early adoption across a subset of employees. More than 90% of these employees are regularly using Copilot to save time drafting emails, summarize meetings and actions, and more effectively search for information across the web and internal assets. Now, the company is rolling out the solution across its wider workforce so employees around the world can benefit from its time-saving options to focus on more strategic tasks.

Global life sciences leader Bayer is using Copilot for Microsoft 365 to deliver productivity and collaboration benefits across its Crop Science, Pharmaceutical and Consumer Health divisions. With more than 700 use cases identified, they are already seeing a big impact from its implementation. Copilot is helping to summarize communications and expedite the search for information, saving employees hundreds of hours. Bayer also developed the Model Store — a Copilot plugin leveraging the Microsoft Teams platform — to search for information using natural language to close communication gaps between data scientists and laboratory researchers, locate the source of data faster, reduce barriers to finding information and help collaborate with the expert source. For example, Copilot helped a U.S. researcher identify a predictive model already developed by a researcher in Germany, preventing a duplicate model from being developed and saving two to three months of work.

Multinational brewer Carlsberg unified its developer organization around an integrated platform using GitHub Enterprise — reducing their toolchain from six tools to a single platform. This allowed for the seamless and effective integration of GitHub Copilot, which enhanced the synergy in their workflow and removed development roadblocks by providing valuable coding suggestions. Copilot adoption has been overwhelmingly positive, enhancing productivity across teams and proving to be a valuable learning tool for cloud developers by easing the learning curve required when working with new languages and platforms.

One of the top media companies in the world, dentsu, is using Copilot for Microsoft 365 to revolutionize workflows, support its talent and help rethink its services across a growing number of channels. By reducing and removing tactical tasks, employees can focus on the strategic part of their work to collaborate creatively. Employees are saving 30-40 minutes a day using Copilot for tasks such as summarizing chats, generating presentations and building executive summaries. They are reinvesting their time to focus on more thoughtful work without interruption, while having content served up within their workflows. Employees are now averaging 30-60 minutes less time on first drafts of messaging and 80% say they have a very positive view of Copilot.

Food industry giant Grupo Bimbo turned to Microsoft’s Azure AI technologies — including Azure OpenAI Service, Form Recognizer and Cognitive Search — to develop a copilot solution in two weeks that helped employees make queries about company policies. The copilot for internal control and risk management employs advanced AI technology to seamlessly convey information in a synthesized format, complemented by readily accessible reference links that pinpoint the exact sources of global policy. It can also respond in all languages where the company has collaborators and operations, no matter what language the query is originally made in. The primary benefit for the company has been its ability to promote compliance across 34 countries. Now, they are replicating the technology to build a copilot product that empowers all individuals and departments. For example, the copilot is helping their communications team draft emails, craft content for social media, propose images for marketing products, translate text and more.

U.S. healthcare organization Providence faced a deluge of incoming messages that required triage and interfered with the time providers needed to spend with their patients. Providence clinicians, informaticists and AI specialists developed a tool based on Azure OpenAI Service named ProvARIA to classify messages, direct them to the appropriate caregiver and free providers to focus on patient care. Providence piloted the tool with four separate clinics representing 27 different doctors and nurse practitioners, funneling all electronic communications into a centralized inbox in a single office. A group of medical assistants worked together to address the messages, processing about 10,000 messages in one month with a 35% improvement in turnaround time. Other groups within Providence enthusiastically joined the pilot, introducing efficiencies that allowed clinics to manage messages with fewer medical assistants — a boon when the limited number of qualified medical assistants is in high demand. Providence medical assistants are now processing 5,000 messages per day, covering 145 Providence clinics and 650 providers. The most profound outcome is one that cannot be measured, and one that had not been anticipated: caregivers have gained peace of mind knowing they have the time and focus to help all patients who need it.

One of the largest digital telco companies in Asia, Telkomsel, needed a way to ensure its customer support team was not overwhelmed by sharply rising demand. The company upgraded a virtual assistant within two weeks with Azure OpenAI Service to improve interactions across its 159 million mobile subscriber base and 8.5 million fixed broadband customers. The virtual agent is helping customer support agents deal with more complex issues without the distraction of routine inquiries and is reducing burnout from facing long call queues. By infusing light-hearted humor and emoticons into the conversation, the new virtual assistant “Veronika” intelligently combines the latest information from multiple FAQs to supply more insightful answers with a personal touch. Telkomsel has scaled the solution to handle up to 5 million transactions per month while delivering the robust security it requires. Since its introduction, self-service interactions have risen from 19% to 45%, with a 140% increase in average messages per user. Customer service agents who used to handle 8,000 calls a day now handle 1,000, freeing up time to increase their cross-selling efforts.

Leading telecommunications and technology company Telstra has scaled its AI adoption following promising pilots of generative AI solutions with front-line team members. Leveraging the Microsoft Cloud and Azure OpenAI Service capabilities, two pilot programs were developed: One Sentence Summary and Ask Telstra. Using Azure OpenAI Service’s large language models, One Sentence Summary transforms customer notes, interactions and transactions into a concise summary of a customer’s recent history and status. The solution enhances the efficiency and quality of interactions, reducing the need for customers to repeat information. Ninety percent of employees using the tool saved time and increased effectiveness, resulting in 20% less follow-up contact. Ask Telstra enables employees to search the company’s extensive internal knowledge base quickly and easily for information, powered by Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Search. Employees were able to gather information faster and more easily for customers, with over 80% agreeing the technology had a positive impact on customer interactions. Now the company is rolling out the pilots across all contact centers and store teams throughout 2024.

To pursue its digital transformation efforts, global multi-energy company TotalEnergies launched Microsoft Copilot to provide employees with a secure AI chat solution based on internal data. After a successful test phase across 300 employees, the company also launched Copilot for Microsoft 365 for their employees, resulting in improved operational efficiency and user adoption.

This platform is the first and only AI-driven X-ray diagnostic tool in Southeast Asia to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) certification, propelling Vietnam into the top six nations globally with FDA-approved AI products for chest X-ray diagnostics. Comprehensive screening is achieving an accuracy rate of up to 95%, and advanced imaging capabilities allow for the detection of liver cancer tumors as small as 5mm to help facilitate early-stage intervention and curative treatment. The tool is also reducing initial screening times by 80-85% and lowering time to analyze cases from 30 minutes to 5 minutes per case.

To scale digital platforms to more than 300 million businesses, public sector organizations and consumers across Europe and Africa, Vodafone is leveraging Microsoft’s generative AI to provide highly personalized and differentiated customer experiences across multiple channels. Their investment is already reinventing how Vodafone engages with customers and accelerating digital transformation. Early testing shows that AI-powered assistants are reducing average handling times and providing AI-generated responses with greater accuracy. Thanks to faster and more accurate responses, the company is also improving customer satisfaction scores.

Leading manufacturer Volvo Group needed the ability to extract data from images — such as photographs, stamps and printed text with handwritten notes over it — and translate documents to and from multiple languages to help its workers streamline invoices and claims document processing. Built on Microsoft Azure, Volvo created a six-week pilot program with a solution using Microsoft Azure AI services and AI Document Intelligence. After a four-month production timeline, they launched a solution that simplified document processing and meets the objectives of data extraction that has saved employees more than 10,000 manual hours — about 850-plus manual hours per month. Now, employees are enjoying their work more, with additional time to focus on innovation and tasks related to their specific skill sets.

Microsoft makes the promise of AI in healthcare real through new collaborations with healthcare organizations and partners,"Just over a year ago, the healthcare industry was energized by the debut of generative AI and the promise this new technology held for delivering real-world outcomes that positively impact clinicians, patients, health systems, and the broader health and life sciences ecosystem. Since then, it has been a catalyst for the development of new use cases, opening possibilities for an entirely new era of innovation — and this shows no signs of slowing down. We continue to see AI adoption within healthcare grow, with 79% of healthcare organizations reporting that they’re currently using AI technology, according to a Microsoft-commissioned study through IDC[i]. AI also has a demonstrable business value, with healthcare organizations realizing a return on their AI investments within 14 months, along with an average return of $3.20 for every $1 they invest in AI[ii].

Working alongside healthcare organizations, Microsoft is making the promise of AI real by empowering the industry to tackle its biggest challenges and create a real difference in the lives of clinicians and patients. At the 2024 HIMSS Global Health Conference & Exhibition, we are highlighting how providers are adopting generative AI solutions and the impact the technology is making.

Stanford Medicine and Microsoft announced the enterprise-wide deployment of Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience Copilot (DAX Copilot), providing conversational, ambient and generative AI to Stanford Medicine’s clinicians. This deployment aligns with Stanford Medicine’s mission to alleviate physician burnout and enhance patient care by streamlining administrative tasks. Stanford Medicine’s commitment to innovation, coupled with DAX Copilot’s ability to automate clinical documentation, has led to significant improvements in efficiency and patient-focused care. DAX Copilot enables healthcare organizations to adopt AI-powered clinical documentation applications at scale, leveraging existing investments in our trusted and extensible Dragon solutions.

Through this initiative, Providence aims to transform healthcare delivery and improve outcomes by harnessing the power of the cloud and advanced AI technologies.

Reinforcing our commitment to Responsible AI

As incredible as AI – and all its potential – is, the important role clinicians play in determining its use and enabling responsible AI guidelines is vital. That’s why we remain steadfast in our commitment to our Responsible AI principles, which help to ensure safe, fair and responsible use of the technology. As part of this ongoing commitment, Microsoft has joined a consortium of healthcare leaders to announce the formation of the Trustworthy & Responsible AI Network (TRAIN), creating one of the first health AI networks aimed at operationalizing responsible AI principles to improve the quality, safety and trustworthiness of AI in health.

Serving as the technology-enabling partner for TRAIN, Microsoft is working with members that include AdventHealth, Advocate Health, Boston Children’s Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Duke Health, Johns Hopkins Medicine, Mass General Brigham, MedStar Health, Mercy, Mount Sinai Health System, Northwestern Medicine, Providence, Sharp HealthCare, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and Vanderbilt University Medical Center – to share best practices and provide tools to enable measurement of outcomes associated with the implementation of AI. Additionally, OCHIN, which serves a national network of community health organizations with solutions, expertise, clinical insights and tailored technologies, and TruBridge, a partner and conduit to community healthcare, will work with TRAIN to help ensure that every organization, regardless of resources, has access to the benefits the network offers.

Additionally, we continue to take the necessary steps to ensure healthcare organizations can implement technology in compliance with the highest levels of security and privacy in mind. We recently announced the preview of healthcare data solutions in Microsoft Fabric, which enables healthcare organizations to break down data silos and harmonize their disparate healthcare data in a single unified store where analytics and AI workloads can operate at-scale. We are also pleased to share that Fabric now supports HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance, allowing our U.S. healthcare industry customers and partners to compliantly use Fabric to store, process and analyze data.

Driving innovation through the Microsoft partner ecosystem

Microsoft’s unmatched global ecosystem of trusted partners is one of the key components that helps drive our innovation forward. This week, Cognizant announced that its TriZetto Assistant on Facets will leverage Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service and Semantic Kernel to provide access to generative AI within the TriZetto user interface. This new collaboration will help increase productivity and efficiency for healthcare payers and providers, while ensuring timely responses and improved care for patients.

Additionally, Microsoft for Startups announced a new collaboration with the American Medical Association’s (AMA) Physician Innovation Network. The Physician Innovation Network is a powerful match-making tool developed by the AMA to connect physicians, care team members, business liaisons and entrepreneurs in a shared mission to enhance healthcare. The collaboration extends the reach of the Physician Innovation Network to all startup founders in the Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, so whether they’re driven to improve healthcare, collaborate with industry leaders or learn from healthcare experts, they will have access to a unique space for connection and innovation.

Without a doubt, these are incredibly exciting times, and we are proud to see our customers and partners adopting Microsoft’s generative AI solutions and putting them to use in the real world to make a meaningful impact in the lives of clinicians and patients.  We look forward to continuing to play a leading role in fostering innovation with generative AI, and empowering healthcare providers and partners across the entire health and life sciences industries with leading-edge and responsible AI technologies that contribute to better experiences and outcomes in healthcare.

Introducing Microsoft Copilot for Finance – the newest Copilot offering in Microsoft 365 designed to transform modern finance,"
		Today we’re announcing the public preview of Microsoft Copilot for Finance, the newest Copilot offering designed for business functions that extends Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and revolutionizes how finance teams approach their daily work. Copilot for Finance joins Copilot for Sales and Copilot for Service, now generally available, to provide AI-powered, role-based workflow automation, recommendations and guided actions in the flow of work.
Finance departments are critical partners in strategic decisions impacting the direction of a company. Eighty percent of finance leaders and teams face challenges to take on more strategic work outside the operational portions of their roles[1]. However, 62% of finance professionals say they are stuck in the drudgery of data entry and review cycles [2]. Copilot for Finance can help free up time for finance to play more of a strategic role in delivering counsel and insights to the business by streamlining financial tasks, automating workflows and providing insights in the flow of work.
Copilot for Finance includes Copilot for Microsoft 365, which means it supercharges Excel, Outlook and other widely used productivity apps with workflow and data-specific insights for the finance professional. Copilot for Finance draws on essential context from your existing financial data sources, including traditional Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, such as Microsoft Dynamics 365 and SAP, and the Microsoft Graph.
In public preview today, Copilot for Finance introduces several key features to enhance financial operations:

Helps financial analysts quickly conduct a variance analysis in Excel using natural language prompts to review data sets for anomalies, risks and unmatched values. This type of analysis helps finance provide strategic insights to business leaders about where it is meeting, exceeding or falling short of planned financial outcomes and why.
Simplifies the reconciliation process in Excel with automated data structure comparisons and guided troubleshooting to help move from insight to action, which helps ensure the reliability and accuracy of financial records.
Provides a complete summary of relevant customer account details in Outlook, such as balance statements and invoices, to expedite the collections process.
Enables customers to turn raw data in Excel into presentation-ready visuals and reports ready to be shared across Outlook and Teams.

Customers transforming business operations with Microsoft Copilot
The Copilot offerings designed for business functions help workers tackle a common problem: getting from insights to impact – with the relevant data and workflows specific to their roles. The latest Work Trend Index survey revealed that people are drowning in data. Roughly a quarter of their day is spent searching for information – roughly 50% of the information they consume each day is deemed necessary for their job, and a recent survey found roles like sales, finance and supply chain have role-specific needs from their data.
Copilot helps break down information and application silos while actively deriving insights, recommendations and guidance from a variety of data sources — all in accordance with Microsoft’s responsible AI principles. With Microsoft Copilot Studio, businesses can further customize Copilot for business processes inside of Copilot for Microsoft 365 and its role-based extensions.
Copilot for Sales is already helping sellers at more than 30,000 organizations. Companies including dentsu, Lumen Technologies, Northern Trust, Schneider Electric, Visa and hundreds more are empowering their employees with Copilot across their sales, service and finance departments.
Here is what a few of the companies had to say:

“Artificial intelligence is transforming the way businesses operate and thrive. At dentsu, we are constantly searching for ways to bring the power of generative AI to all our employees with a framework defined on ethical and responsible AI principles. Building on the existing use cases we’ve defined to empower our workforce with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Copilot for Sales, we are excited to participate in the preview of Microsoft Copilot for Finance. We see potential for Copilot for Finance to accelerate the impact of our finance professionals by optimizing routine processes, and we anticipate efficiency gains will free up finance capacity to focus on performance across our organization.” – Carolyn Isaacs, Global Director Finance Services, dentsu
“Northern Trust’s digital workplace transformation is rooted in empowering our employees with technology that enhances and optimizes the services that they provide our clients. Deploying Microsoft Copilot for Service is a milestone in this transformation journey and we are excited for the potential of this AI-powered solution to help modernize our client relations organization, streamline processes for our employees, and elevate our client experience.” – Shaelyn Otikor SVP, Head of Global Digital Workplace Strategy, Asset Servicing, Northern Trust
“Building on our 30-year history of embracing AI, Visa is on a journey to roll out generative AI across our entire company to empower our employees and develop new solutions to serve and protect our cardholders, merchants and the broader ecosystem. We’ve seen our employees embrace the broad rollout of Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, and we’re excited to continue to bring employees new ways to take advantage of the technology, transforming the ways in which we work and how we service our clients.” – Don Hobson, Chief Information Officer, Visa

At Microsoft, we are also an AI-powered organization, leveraging Copilot for Sales and Copilot for Service to improve seller and agent workflows and transform customer experiences:

Microsoft Copilot for Sales empowers sellers to close deals faster with AI-assisted insights and recommendations. Our study of Microsoft sellers who use Copilot for Sales at least weekly found it makes them more productive, saving an average of 90 minutes per week – and 67% reported it allowed them to spend more time with customers.

“We have seen firsthand that an AI-powered sales organization is a more successful sales organization. Not only has Copilot for Sales helped our global sales team simplify tasks and save time, but it has also strengthened our customer relationships with AI-supported insights and recommendations that are personalized and tailored to each customer.” – Judson Althoff, Microsoft EVP and Chief Commercial Officer


Microsoft Copilot for Service is modernizing the contact center with AI to enhance service experiences and boost agent productivity. In Microsoft’s customer service department – one of the largest in the world – there has been a 12% reduction in average case handling times (the time actively spent on resolving customer cases via chat) in two different customer support business areas while using similar capabilities in Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service. The benefits and use cases from our own Copilot deployment will continue to shape Copilot for Service and its capabilities.

“Generative AI has been a game-changer for our own contact center at Microsoft. Agents spend less time searching for information, allowing them to focus more time on helping customers solve complex challenges. Moreover, newer agents experience significant benefits, feeling more confident and capable in their roles. This has led to reduced onboarding times and increased job satisfaction.” – Mala Anand, Microsoft CVP Customer Experience & Success


Microsoft Copilot for Finance streamlines financial processes and surfaces insights for better-informed decision making. Microsoft’s world-class finance organization has long prioritized adoption of AI and automation tools to modernize operations, reduce financial risk and support the company’s priorities with strategic insights. The team has helped inform the Copilot for Finance product capabilities and roadmap.

“Our finance organization is just like any other – looking for technology to help us do our work in a more efficient and impactful way – and we’re excited to track our journey as customer zero of Microsoft Copilot for Finance” – Cory Hrncirik, Modern Finance Lead, Microsoft



Companies of all sizes are moving beyond AI experimentation and embracing Microsoft Copilot to strategically empower those closest to their customer interactions and critical operations to create new business value.

Accelerating telco transformation in the era of AI,"AI is redefining digital transformation for every industry, including telecommunications. Every operator’s AI journey will be distinct. But each AI journey requires cloud-native transformation, which provides the foundation for any organization to harness the full potential of AI, driving innovation, efficiency and business value.

This new era of AI will create incredible economic growth and represent a profound shift as a percentage impact on global GDP, which is just over $100 trillion. So, when we look at the potential value driven by this next generation of AI technology, we may see a boost to global GDP of an additional $7 trillion to $10 trillion.

Embracing AI will help operators unlock new revenue streams, deliver superior customer experiences and pioneer future innovations for growth.

The AI-powered future cloud for telecommunications

Operators can now leverage cloud services that are adaptive, purpose-built for telecommunications and span from near edge on-premises environments to the far edges of Earth and space to monetize investments, modernize networks, elevate customer experiences and streamline business operations with AI.

Our aim is to be the most trusted co-innovation partner for the telecommunications industry. We want to help accelerate telco transformation and empower operators to succeed in the era of AI, which is why we are committed to working with operators, enterprises and developers on the future cloud.

At MWC in Barcelona this week, we are announcing updates to our Azure for Operators portfolio to help operators seize the opportunity ahead in a cloud- and AI-native future.

Monetize investments and unlock innovation for customers

AI opens new growth opportunities for operators. The biggest potential is that operators, as they embrace this new era of cloud and AI, can also help their customers in their own transformation.

For example, spam calls and malicious activities are a well-known menace and are growing exponentially, and often impact the most vulnerable members of society. Besides the annoyance, the direct cost of those calls adds up. For example, in the United States, FTC data for 2023 shows $850 million in reported fraud losses stemming from scam calls.

Today, we are announcing the public preview of Azure Operator Call Protection, a new service that uses AI to help protect consumers from scam calls. The service uses real-time analysis of voice content, alerting consumers who opt into the service when there is suspicious in-call activity. Azure Operator Call Protection works on any endpoint, mobile or landline, and it works entirely through the network without needing any app installation.

In the U.K., BT Group is trialing Azure Operator Call Protection to identify, educate and protect their customers from potential fraud, making it harder for bad actors to take advantage of their customers.

We are also announcing the public preview of Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC), which provides a unified, standard interface across operators’ networks. APC provides seamless access to Open Gateway for developers to create cloud and edge-native applications that interact with the intelligence of the network. APC also empowers operators to commercialize their network APIs and simplifies their access for developers and is available in the Azure Marketplace.

Run AI-driven networks on a carrier-grade, hybrid cloud platform

AI opens incredible opportunities to modernize network operations, providing new levels of real-time insights, intelligence and automation. Operators, such as Three UK, are already using Azure Operator Insights to eliminate data silos and deliver actionable business insights by enabling the collection and analysis of massive quantities of network data gathered from complex multi-vendor network functions. Designed for operator-specific workloads, operators tackle complex scenarios with Azure Operator Insights, such as understanding the health of their networks and the quality of their subscribers’ experiences.

Azure Operator Insights uses a modern data mesh architecture for dividing complex domains into manageable sub-domains called data products. These data products integrate large datasets from different sources and vendors to provide data visibility from disaggregated networks for comprehensive analytical and business insights. Using this data product factory capability, operators, network equipment providers and solution integrators can create unique data products for one customer or published to the Azure Marketplace for many customers to use.

Today, we are also announcing the limited preview of Copilot in Azure Operator Insights, a groundbreaking, operator-focused, generative AI capability helping operators move from reactive to proactive and predictive in tangible ways. Engineers use the Copilot to interact with network insights using natural language and receive simple explanations of what the data means and possible actions to take, resolving network issues quickly and accurately, ultimately improving customer satisfaction.

Copilot in Azure Operator Insights is delivering AI-infused insights to drive network efficiency for customers like Three UK and participating partners including Amdocs, Accenture and BMC Remedy. Three UK is using Copilot in Azure Operator Insights to unlock actionable intelligence on network health and customer experience quality of service, a process that previously took weeks or months to assess, is now possible to perform in minutes.

Additionally, with our next-generation hybrid cloud platform, Azure Operator Nexus, we offer the ability to future-proof the network to support mission-critical workloads, and power new revenue-generating services and applications. This immense opportunity is what drives operators to modernize their networks with Azure Operator Nexus, a carrier-grade, hybrid cloud platform and AI-powered automation and insights — unlocking improved efficiency, scalability and reliability. Purpose-built for and validated by tier one operators to run mission-critical workloads, Azure Operator Nexus enables operators to run workloads on-premises or on Azure, where they can seamlessly deploy, manage, secure and monitor everything — from the bare metal to the tenant.

E& UAE is taking advantage of the Azure Operator Nexus platform to lower total cost of ownership (TCO), leverage the power of AI to simplify operations, improve time to market and focus on their core competencies.  And operations at AT&T that took months with previous generations of technology now take weeks to complete with Azure Operator Nexus.

We continue to build robust capabilities into Azure Operator Nexus, including new deployment options giving operators the flexibility to use one carrier-grade platform to deliver innovative solutions on near-edge, far-edge and enterprise edge.

Read more about the latest Azure for Operator updates here.

Accelerate business transformation with AI

Operators are creating differentiation by collaborating with us to improve customer experiences and streamline their business operations with AI. Operators are leveraging Microsoft’s copilot stack and copilot experiences across our core products and services, such as Microsoft Copilot, Microsoft Copilot for M365 and Microsoft Security Copilot to drive productivity and improve customer experiences.

Last year AT&T launched Ask AT&T, a generative AI tool designed to help employees be more effective, creative and innovative. An early use case for Ask AT&T was to enable software developers to write and refine code — in many cases, AT&T is seeing a 25-50% productivity gain for their developers. Since its launch, the company has identified many other use cases for the solution. Today, approximately 68,000 employees have access to Ask AT&T and are using it for anything from vulnerability remediation in IT to analysis of the vast data flows the company manages on its network. The company is currently training Ask AT&T on contracts and financial materials to assist with HR questions and making our care representatives even more effective at supporting our customers.
Teams at Lumen use Copilot to surface relevant policies, summarize tickets and easily find repair instructions from manuals. They can quickly create presentations, new business proposals and statements of work. Giving their workforce the digital tools they need to deliver dramatically improved customer experiences with greater ease is an essential part of the company’s transformation.
Telefónica evolves Kernel, its digital framework for the creation of advanced services, to the next level by adding new Microsoft Azure AI services to power every relevant use case with generative AI capabilities at scale. New Kernel 2.0 integrates all the digital services from the Telefónica Group to enable private-first, secure and standardized access to data and APIs, providing a foundation for value-added services that can be developed faster and with higher customer impact.
Indonesian-based Telkomsel introduced Veronika — a virtual assistant that integrates Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service. Veronika is rooted in natural language processing and machine learning, and recommends telco packages based on customers’ needs, and it can quickly and accurately address customer concerns. Since deploying Veronika, Telkomsel has been able to address rising call volumes without increasing agents. They have seen a significant drop in call volumes for their agents who are now handling 1,000 calls a day (down from 8,000 previously) and can now focus on increased cross-selling.
To increase customer satisfaction, Vodafone will apply the power of Microsoft Azure OpenAI to deliver frictionless, real-time, proactive and hyper-personalized experiences across all Vodafone customer touchpoints, including its digital assistant TOBi (available in 13 countries).

An average operator spends 20% of annual revenue on capital expenditures. However, this investment does not translate into an equivalent increase in revenue growth. Operators need to empower their service teams with data-driven insights to increase productivity, enhance care, use conversational AI to enable self-service, expedite issue resolution and deliver frictionless customer experiences at scale.

Partnering with Microsoft in the era of AI

Together with our partner ecosystem, we are investing in creating a comprehensive set of solutions for the telecommunications industry. This includes the Azure for Operators portfolio — a carrier-grade hybrid cloud platform, voice core, mobile core and multi-access edge compute, as well as our suite of generative AI solutions that holistically address the needs of network operators as they transform their networks.

As customers continue to embrace generative AI, we remain committed to working with operators and enterprises alike to future-proof networks and unlock new revenue streams in a cloud- and AI-native future.

Microsoft Fabric: A single analytics platform for sustainability data
In May 2023, we unveiled Microsoft Fabric, an end-to-end, analytics SaaS platform that brings together all of an organization’s enterprise data, including ESG data that the company may not have had access to before. With Microsoft Fabric, your teams can connect to data from anywhere, uncover insights using AI-powered analytics tools in a unified experience, and embed those insights in the applications your people use every day to drive action and improve decision-making.
Now in preview, sustainability data solutions in Microsoft Fabric allows organizations to accelerate their time to insights and sustainability progress by providing out-of-the-box ESG data model, connectors and reporting. By connecting your ESG data with Microsoft Fabric you can turn volumes of sustainability data into meaningful insights and progress.
Copilot and intelligent insights: AI assistance for better, faster decisions 
With centrally managed data and Copilot in Microsoft Sustainability Manager, now in preview, organizations can use powerful generative AI and natural language queries to gain faster lines of sight into and answers out of data. Organizations can ask Copilot questions, and Copilot will work across Microsoft Sustainability Manager to:

Quickly analyze environmental data and surface reduction opportunities in areas like carbon and water use, saving work and time.
Talk to sustainability data — ask questions and retrieve answers quickly.
Draft sustainability preparatory reports, reducing time and freeing up resources to focus on other priorities.

With intelligent insights in Microsoft Sustainability Manager, also in preview, organizations get an integrated and interactive AI model enabling deeper analysis of calculated emissions data. Using it, they can:

See where their data needs cleaning or where more complete data is needed.
Scan the organization’s data to identify both short- and long-term reduction opportunities.
Fine-tune decisions based on historical trends, seasonality and data anomalies.

Södra, Sweden’s largest forest-owner association with 52,000 owners of responsibly managed forests, processes sustainable raw materials from members’ forests into renewable products. Using Microsoft Sustainability Manager with new AI capabilities, Södra has improved sustainability practices like reporting through automated flows that enable employees to more easily collect detailed information.
“With the AI capabilities in Microsoft Sustainability Manager, we can be more productive, which is our ultimate goal,” shares Cristian Brolin, Chief Digital Officer at Södra. “We found the Copilot feature very easy to use and my vision and ambition is that this will help accelerate the way we work. We are excited to see how this solution helps accelerate our sustainability progress.”
ESG value chain solution: Working with suppliers to drive reductions
For most organizations, supplier activities can account for upward of 80-90% of their emissions footprint. Getting a handle on this data is critical to meeting reduction targets and reporting requirements.
ESG value chain solution in Microsoft Sustainability Manager, now generally available, allows organizations to simplify data collection and provides a seamless and more secure process for suppliers. Organizations can run advanced analytics on ESG value chain data in one place and find emissions reduction opportunities within their value chain.
At Microsoft, our procurement team has found that getting data out of siloed reports, spreadsheets, and systems into one data estate and sharing learnings with others is key to advancing our own progress as well as others’ progress. Through more automated data gathering and management, such as through ESG value chain solution, we can not only more easily share data but also respond more nimbly to changing regulatory requirements.
Driving sustainable business toward new growth opportunities 
According to research by the United Nations and Accenture, 98% of CEOs see sustainability as a core to their role, and two out of three are forming partnerships and taking action on sustainability. Many are also translating these actions into new business models and growth.
Allegiant Stadium, home to the Las Vegas Raiders, is using Microsoft Sustainability Manager to support a state-of-the art and energy efficient facility that hosted the 2024 Super Bowl. Allegiant obtained LEED Gold certification, is 100% powered by renewable energy from local solar farms and is using Microsoft solutions to help organize data to inform decisions about resource utilization.
Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability is designed to be extensible by partners, including experts operating at the intersections of sustainability and AI. For example, Avanade’s copilot for ESG takes the friction out of regulatory compliance reporting, generating audit-ready reports against new and existing ESG frameworks.
We are proud to have a growing, global ecosystem of sustainability solution, advisory and implementation partners working closely with us, to build and deploy capabilities that can address the broad, multifaceted and complex challenges in sustainability.
At the intersection of sustainability and AI, the possibilities are vast for any organization to refocus business around transforming operations, reinventing brands and exploring new business opportunities. Microsoft AI delivers on this potential and the needs of our customers with a responsible approach to AI that’s based on robust evaluation, verification and validation.
Using the power of data and AI, sustainability progress isn’t just possible but tangible. Organizations can gain efficiency and accuracy in decision-making and reporting as well as new ways of doing and growing business — on an exciting, shared path to a transformative future.

Walmart unveils new generative AI-powered capabilities for shoppers and associates,"
		Time and money are two of the most valuable resources people have. And one of the most popular ways for Americans to save on both, is shopping online. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, American families spend six hours per week on household planning and shopping. Many of those families do so digitally at Walmart. The world’s largest retailer, famous for its low prices, generated over $82 billion in e-commerce sales in fiscal year 2023 and is steadily growing its active digital customers.
In 2024, the company is further improving the digital shopping experience, building generative AI into its search function to deliver customers a helpful and intuitive browsing experience. Using a combination of Walmart proprietary data and technology and large language models, including those available in Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, as well as retail-specific models built by Walmart, the new design serves up a curated list of the personalized items a shopper is looking for.
At CES 2024, Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillon and Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella introduced the new AI innovations to benefit Walmart customers.

Study after study shows that AI is driving impact and value across businesses.

McKinsey reports AI will create $400-660 billion in value for the retail and consumer goods industry.
FTI Consulting data shows nearly 80% of online shoppers believe AI personalization can enhance their online experience.
An IDC study commissioned by Microsoft found that for every $1 a retail and consumer packaged goods company invests in AI, it is seeing a return of $3.45.

Generative AI-powered search
Walmart’s new generative AI-powered search function will be available across iOS, Android and the company’s website. Photo courtesy of Walmart.
Walmart built an all-new generative AI-powered search function across iOS, Android and its own website. The new capability is specifically designed to understand the context of a customer’s query and generate personalized responses. Soon, customers will have a more interactive and conversational experience, get answers to specific questions, and receive personalized product suggestions.
For example, a parent planning a birthday party for a child that loves unicorns. Instead of multiple searches for unicorn-themed balloons, napkins, streamers, etc., the parent can simply ask the question “Help me plan a unicorn-themed party for my daughter.”
One of the reasons why Walmart and other leading retailers are choosing Azure OpenAI Service is the ability to access the most advanced AI models in the world while backed by the enterprise-grade capabilities found in Microsoft Azure including security, compliance and regional availability. Generative AI in retail is particularly exciting as it can help usher in a new way of shopping; shifting from “scroll searching” to “goal searching,” which makes the digital shopping experience more seamless and intuitive.
Don’t forget about the associates!
Walmart’s generative AI-powered “My Assistant” app helps associates with a range of tasks, from summarizing long documents to assisting in the creation of new content. Photo courtesy of Walmart.
Both Walmart and Microsoft share an aligned vision around how AI can help organizations and their people be more productive, more satisfied in their work and go on to solve the most pressing problems.
Over the summer, Walmart launched a new tool, giving its 50,000 non-store associates access to its new “My Assistant” app, which was created and built by Walmart and leverages a unique build of Walmart proprietary data, technology and large language models in Azure OpenAI Service. In just a few months, the app has already made a big impact for associates, assisting with a range of tasks, from summarizing long documents to assisting in the creation of new content.
A history of success
This is just the latest evolution in the Walmart and Microsoft relationship.
In 2018, the companies established a strategic partnership to drive Walmart’s digital transformation. As one of Walmart’s preferred and strategic cloud providers, Microsoft has supported Walmart on a variety of different cloud projects. From powering access to electronic health records at its in-store clinics to centralizing, democratizing and optimizing data, the companies have and will continue to collaborate to accelerate innovation.
Other ways to AI
While Walmart’s approach to generative AI uses a combination of large language models, retail-specific models, and their own proprietary data built on top of Azure OpenAI Service, other retailers may have different scenarios that require an alternative approach. That’s why Microsoft offers a broad portfolio of prebuilt, low-code and pro-code solutions that can benefit all retailers and shoppers, no matter where they are on their respective journey.

"Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty now generally available, opening new pathways for government innovation","Today, we’re announcing general availability of Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty across all Azure regions. Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty helps governments meet their compliance, security, and policy requirements while utilizing the cloud to provide superior value to their citizens.

Governments around the world must meet a wide range of national and regional compliance requirements for applications and workloads, including governance, security controls, privacy, and in some cases data residency and sovereign protections. Until now, most solutions for addressing these regulatory requirements have relied upon private cloud and on-premises environments, creating a lag in adoption of scalable, secure and resilient cloud capabilities.

Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty — offering governance, security, transparency and sovereign technology — supports the digital transformation of government customers unlike any other cloud provider in the world. Customers gain automation of best practices to address regulatory requirements while benefiting from the rapid pace of innovation in the hyperscale cloud.

Advancing conversations about sovereignty in the hyperscale cloud

When we talk with government customers, we hear common questions in terms of achieving data sovereignty in the cloud. These often include questions around (1) residency, security and compliance of the hyperscale cloud; (2) controls for data access; and (3) the complexity of addressing regulations that vary by country.

First, Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is built on the foundation of more than 60 cloud regions, providing industry-leading cybersecurity along with the broadest compliance coverage. Microsoft offers the most regions of any cloud provider. Customers can implement policies to contain their data and applications within their preferred geographic boundary, in alignment with national or regional data residency requirements.

Second, Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty provides sovereign controls to protect and encrypt sensitive data and control access to that data, enabled by sovereign landing zones and Azure Confidential Computing.

A sovereign landing zone is a type of Azure landing zone designed for organizations that need government-regulated privacy, security and sovereign controls. Organizations can leverage landing zones as a repeatable best-practice for secure and consistent development and deployment of cloud services. As many government organizations face a complex and layered regulatory landscape, utilizing sovereign landing zones makes it much easier to design, develop, deploy and audit solutions while enforcing compliance with defined policies.

Customers can also leverage Azure Confidential Computing to secure sensitive and regulated data even while it’s being processed in the cloud. Azure Confidential Computing protects data in memory in hardware-based trusted execution environments, helping prevent unwanted data access by the cloud provider, administrators and users. Customers can benefit from this capability on Azure without having to change existing applications.

Third, customers can adopt specific, sovereignty-focused Azure policy initiatives to address the complexity of compliance with national and regional regulatory requirements. These help customers create cloud guardrails and enforce specific regulations more easily. Customers can layer these policy initiatives to form a complete solution for their specific needs, and use deployment automation to ensure consistency, best practices and save time.

For example, our customers typically start with Azure Cloud Security Benchmark then layer the new Sovereignty Policy Baseline to ensure best practices for digital sovereignty. Then, customers can leverage a regional specific layer, such as Baseline informatiebeveiliging overheid (BIO), a foundational standards framework for information security within the Netherlands government, or the strategic guidelines for migration to the cloud of data and digital services of the Italian Public Administration National Cybersecurity Agency (ACN).

Additionally, the new Cloud Security Alliance Cloud Controls Matrix (CSA CCM v4) policy initiative is oriented toward a global standard that many other regional standards build upon.

Customer and partner collaborations delivering local solutions

Through our product development lifecycle, we’ve had the privilege of collaborating with customers around the world and their trusted partners. These collaborations continue to inform both our technical roadmap as well as solution design and delivery.

In the Netherlands, the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC-NL) has achieved significant traction in their work to establish a cloud center of excellence, deploying Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty to accelerate innovation in the cloud while still managing sovereign controls. Arnoud van Petersen, CIO & Head of IT Services at NCSC-NL, explains: “Our innovation teams are exploring ways to use advanced data and AI capabilities to reduce the time required to interpret signal data and produce advisories from days to minutes, delivering an EU leading rapid response and information sharing in a dynamic cyber threat landscape.”

The municipality of Amsterdam is partnering with InSpark (a subsidiary of Royal KPN) to bring on-premises datacenter workloads to the cloud in compliance with the relevant classification within the Dutch BIO regulation. Patrick Scholte, Director Platforms & Development, shares: “Municipality of Amsterdam opted for Cloud for Sovereignty primarily due to privacy considerations, specifically in compliance with GDPR. Beyond its effective implementation of innovative security technologies, Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty plays a crucial role in facilitating significant internal advancement for us.

“As an organization, it is imperative for us to address the establishment of processes, policies, and guidelines, as an addition to the use of innovative technologies that pertain to data sovereignty,” Scholte adds. “These measures are essential in mitigating evolving risks, and the use of Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty allows us to encode and audit them effectively.”

In Italy, Leonardo is now migrating their public and private customers to a secure public cloud service on the new Italy North Azure region, leveraging sovereign landing zones and advanced technologies such as Azure Confidential Computing. “We have chosen Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty to deliver solutions for our customers in compliance with digital sovereignty attributes and regulations, leveraging the economies of scale, security levels and pace of innovation that today are only available with hyperscale clouds,” says Massimo Tedeschi, Senior Vice President Cyber & Security Engineering, Leonardo.

In Belgium, Proximus has selected Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty in its work with customers across Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to deliver cloud capabilities along with advanced security layers and sovereignty controls to protect sensitive data in the cloud.

“Our customers expect us to provide them with the highest data protection and sovereignty, says Anne-Sophie Lotgering, Enterprise Market Lead at Proximus. “That is exactly why we collaborate with Microsoft to offer advanced cloud capabilities together with the highest security and privacy controls to our Benelux customers.”

Driving a rapid pace of innovation

As the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty enters general availability today, we’re also announcing new capabilities in preview. These solutions underscore our continued investment in a rapid pace of innovation to advance sovereignty in the hyperscale cloud:

Drift analysis capabilities: Ongoing administration and maintenance can potentially introduce changes that don’t comply with policies, resulting in the deployment beginning to drift out of compliance over time. The new drift analysis tool inspects your deployment and generates a list of non-compliant settings, as well as a severity rating, making it easier to identify any discrepancies to remediate and verify the compliance of specific environments.
Transparency logs: Gives eligible customers visibility into the instances where Microsoft engineers have accessed customer resources through Just-In-Time (JIT) access, most commonly in response to a customer support request. With this update, customers can now request access to the preview feature via the Azure portal.
New configuration tools in the Azure portal: Allows customers to create a new tailored sovereign landing zone in two simple steps using a guided experience.

Tags: AI, Copilot for Microsoft 365, Copilot in Bing, Microsoft Copilot	"
Transforming communications with Copilot for Microsoft 365,"At Microsoft, we’ve asked our communications team to be innovators of AI. To explore and experiment with how we can all use it in our everyday work. We’ve urged the team not to forget their unique expertise and value — the art of communications — but to welcome some science into the process, to be a leader in this new stage of communications.

So, for the last few months we’ve been experimenting with Copilot for Microsoft 365, which is now generally available for enterprises. We’re using Copilot in Teams to story mine with spokespeople and anticipate coverage after interviews. We’re using Copilot in Word to start blogs and draft plans. We’re using chat to test messages, brainstorm and expand our thinking. And Copilot in PowerPoint is helping us create decks that drive clarity and communicate our vision.

We’ve been feeling the impact in our day-to-day but wanted to quantify it — so we did a bit of research ourselves. Using the same methodology featured in our latest Work Trend Index, we surveyed 80 people from our comms and marketing organization and found that— like most knowledge workers —many employees suffer from meeting (70%) and information overload (86%) daily, so it’s not surprising that 80% struggle with having enough focus time each day.

The good news? AI is helping. According to the survey:

86% say Copilot makes them more productive and 81% say it helps them complete tasks faster.
89% say Copilot helps jump-start the creative process and 78% say Copilot improves the quality of their work.
70% say Copilot reduces time spent on tasks they don’t enjoy; specifically, 76% say Copilot reduces mental effort on mundane tasks and 71% say Copilot reduces time spent searching for information.

And the most exciting one for me: 84% say they don’t want to go back to working without Copilot. And I feel the same way. 😊

Now, it’s still early days and the tools aren’t perfect. But to help other communicators consider how AI can improve their work days, here are five ways the team and I are using AI to be more productive, creative, and to make the work we do a little more fun.

1. Meetings and interviews
That meeting overwhelm we feel isn’t just constant back-to-backs; it’s also frequent double-booking and conflicts (if your calendar is anything like mine). Copilot in Teams makes it easier to prioritize your most important meetings and catch up on those you’ve missed — without having to watch the full recording. Some prompts:

Summarize what was discussed in the meeting in short bullet points.
Were there any action items for me?
Were there any unresolved decisions?

During or after a meeting, Copilot can also help you recall what was discussed more accurately, note a great quote or detail for a story, evaluate complex topics, or anticipate coverage following an interview. For example, you can ask:

What was the exact feedback <X> shared about the comms plan that was presented?
The engineer we spoke with shared an interesting anecdote about <X> that I’d like to include in a story I’m working on. Can you remind me exactly what she said?
Put the pros and cons of what the team is discussing about the announcement strategy in a table and recommend a course of action.
After a press interview, ask, “What do you think the reporter will take away from this conversation? Use the transcript as a base document.

2. Message testing
Clarity is key in communications of course, but it’s perhaps even more critical in another setting: the military. Napoleon, the famous general, is known for bringing a corporal to meetings when his generals were presenting war plans. He would ask the corporal, “Having heard these plans, would you know what to do?” If the answer was no, he would ask the generals to re-write their plans.

What does this have to do with AI? I’ve been using Copilot as my corporal to provide fresh perspective. Some examples:

I’ll feed Copilot a blog and ask it to articulate the three key messages; if they’re off, I’ll refine.
I’ll ask Copilot to poke holes in a statement we’re making on a tricky topic, like sustainability or responsible AI. I’ll ask it things like, “If you wanted to disrupt this argument, what would you say?”

With Copilot as my brainstorming partner, I can identify blind spots, sharpen our positions, and expand my thinking so we’re clear and thoughtful in our positionin

3. Preparing spokespeople
To help our spokespeople prepare for press interviews, we’re using Copilot to anticipate questions and develop FAQs. Some example prompts:

Pretend you are a tech reporter. Share the top five questions you would have for me if presented the information in this narrative document: /[X].
Pretend you are a PR person preparing an executive for an interview with a top tech reporter, <X reporter> at <X outlet>. She’s been writing about AI quite a bit. What questions do you think the reporter will ask a tech executive in an interview about how AI will change work?
I’m doing a press interview about <X> what are the top three questions someone unfamiliar with the matter would have on the topic?
Help me draft responses to this list of questions <X>. Answers should be brief, but conversational in tone.

4. Writing comms plans and blogs
Now, many communicators are hired because of their unique ability to write. And as a writer myself, I can tell you that skill isn’t going anywhere — but I’ve found Copilot to be useful in helping me get started, keep going, and refine my content.  It’s helping me do what I do best — even better.

Some examples:

In Word, I’ll highlight a paragraph in a plan or blog that I’m getting hung up on and ask Copilot to suggest a few other ways to write it.
Others on my team use Copilot to draft a plan for an upcoming announcement. They’ll give it a brain dump of the elements they want to see in the plan such as what they’re announcing, key messages, timelines, press targets, and spokespeople. Now, it doesn’t produce a full plan end-to-end, but it gives them a solid start.
When I’m at the end of a blog and am stuck for an ending, I like to ask Copilot to write a short, but compelling closing paragraph. And because we’re using Copilot for Microsoft 365, sensitive information, like launch plans and dates, remain protected.
Finally, when the blog or LinkedIn post is done and I’ve used up all my creativity and still need a title or headline, I can ask for five headlines, then jump off from there.

5. Creating presentations
Sometimes the way we present our ideas is just as important as the actual content. So, it’s no surprise that one of my team’s favorite Copilot use cases is turning a Word document, like a PR plan, into a PowerPoint presentation.

Simply open a new presentation in PowerPoint, select the Copilot icon in the ribbon and once the side pane pops up, click “Create presentation from file…”  Select the document and let Copilot go to work building a deck.

From there, you can ask Copilot to add an end slide, make all the titles a certain font and color, or ask it to update one of the images to a photograph that’s more to your liking. It’s massively cut down the time it takes my team to build decks — meaning they can focus more on content and less on copy-pasting.

Like any new tool or habit the key is practice, practice, practice. If you already have Copilot for Microsoft 365, you can start experimenting with the prompts above today — or test out some of my communications prompts for Copilot in Bing for free. You can also check out this article on WorkLab that shows you how to write a great prompt.

I’ll keep practicing too — and sharing along the way.

Microsoft Copilot for Azure: This is an AI companion for IT that simplifies day-to-day IT administration. More than just a tool, it is a unified chat experience that understands the user’s role and goals, and enhances the ability to design, operate and troubleshoot apps and infrastructure. Copilot for Azure helps IT teams gain new insights into their workloads, unlock untapped Azure functionality and orchestrate tasks across both cloud and edge.
Bringing Copilot to everyone: Our efforts to simplify the user experience and make Copilot more accessible to everyone starts with Bing, our leading experience for the web. Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise will now simply become Copilot. With these changes, when signed in with a Microsoft Entra ID, customers using Copilot in Bing, Edge and Windows will receive the benefit of commercial data protection. Over time, Microsoft will also expand the eligibility of Copilot with commercial data protection to even more Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) users at no additional cost. Copilot (formerly Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise) will be out of preview and become generally available starting Dec. 1. Learn more here.

Reinforcing the data and AI connection
AI is only as good as the data that fuels it. That’s why Microsoft is committed to creating an integrated, simplified experience to connect your data to our AI tools.

Microsoft Fabric is part of that solution. Available now, Microsoft Fabric reshapes how teams work with data by bringing everyone together on a single, AI-powered platform that unifies all those data estates on an enterprise-grade data foundation.

Copilot in Microsoft Fabric also integrates with Microsoft Office and Teams to foster a data culture to scale the power of data value creation throughout the organization. We’ve made more than 100 feature updates since Build and expanded our ecosystem with industry leading partners, and have over 25,000 customers including Milliman, Zeiss, London Stock Exchange and EY using it today.

Unlocking more value for developers with Azure AI
We continue to expand choice and flexibility in generative AI models to offer developers the most comprehensive selection. With Model-as-a-Service, a new feature in the model catalog we announced at Microsoft Build, pro developers will be able to easily integrate the latest AI models, such as Llama 2 from Meta and upcoming premium models from Mistral, and Jais from G42, as API endpoints to their applications. They can also customize these models with their own data without needing to worry about setting up and managing the GPU infrastructure, helping eliminate complexity.

With the preview of Azure AI Studio, there is now a unified and trusted platform to help organizations more easily explore, build, test and deploy AI apps – all in one place. With Azure AI Studio, you can build your own copilots, train your own, or ground other foundational and open models with data that you bring.

And Vector Search, a feature of Azure AI Search, is now generally available, so organizations can generate highly accurate experiences for every user in their generative AI applications.

The new GPT-3.5 Turbo model with a 16K token prompt length will be generally available and GPT-4 Turbo will be in public preview in Azure OpenAI Service at the end of November 2023. GPT-4 Turbo will enable customers to extend prompt length and bring even more control and efficiency to their generative AI applications.

GPT-4 Turbo with Vision is coming soon to preview and DALL·E 3 is now available in public preview in Azure OpenAI Service, helping fuel the next generation of enterprise solutions along with GPT-4, so organizations can pursue advanced functionalities with images. And when used with our Azure AI Vision service, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision even understands video for generating text outputs, furthering human creativity.

Enabling the responsible deployment of AI
Microsoft leads the industry in the safe and responsible use of AI. The company has set the standard with an industry-leading commitment to defend and indemnify commercial customers from lawsuits for copyright infringement – the Copilot Copyright Commitment (CCC).

Today, Microsoft takes its commitment one step further by announcing the expansion of the CCC to customers using Azure OpenAI Service. The new benefit will be called the Customer Copyright Commitment. As part of this expansion, Microsoft has published new documentation to help Azure OpenAI Service customers implement technical measures to mitigate the risk of infringing content. Customers will need to comply with the documentation to take advantage of the benefit.

And Azure AI Content Safety is now generally available, helping organizations detect and mitigate harmful content and create better online experiences. Customers can use Azure AI Content Safety as a built-in-safety system within Azure OpenAI Service, for open-source models as part of their prompt engineering in Azure Machine Learning, or as a standalone API service.

Introducing new experiences in Windows to empower employees, IT and developers
We continue to invest in and build Windows to empower people to navigate the platform shift to AI. We are thrilled to introduce new experiences in Windows 11 and Windows 365 for IT and employees that unlock new ways of working and make more AI accessible across any device. To further our mission of making Windows the home for developers and the best place for AI development, we announced a host of new AI and productivity tools for developers, including Windows AI Studio.

Announcing NVIDIA AI foundry service
Aimed at helping enterprises and startups supercharge the development, tuning and deployment of their own custom AI models on Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA will announce their AI foundry service running on Azure. The NVIDIA AI foundry service pulls together three elements – a collection of NVIDIA AI Foundation models, NVIDIA NeMo framework and tools, and NVIDIA DGX Cloud AI supercomputing and services – that give enterprises an end-to-end solution for creating custom generative AI models. Businesses can then deploy their models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise software on Azure to power generative AI applications, including intelligent search, summarization and content generation.

Strengthening defenses in the era of AI
The threat landscape has evolved dramatically in recent years, and at Microsoft Ignite we are introducing new technologies across Microsoft’s suite of security solutions to help defenders make the world a safer place.

Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender XDR (previously Microsoft 365 Defender) will be combined to create the industry’s first Unified Security Operations Platform, with embedded Security Copilot experiences. With built-in generative AI, it’s a single, powerful experience focused on protecting threats at machine speed and aiding defenders by simplifying the complexity of their environment.

Additionally, the expansion of Security Copilot embedded within Intune, Purview and Entra will help IT administrators, compliance units and identity teams simplify complex scenarios. In Entra, identity administrators can quickly troubleshoot identity access. In Purview, data security alerts deliver rich context to help resolve problems faster. In Intune, IT administrators can use “what if” analysis to keep business running while improving governance and compliance.

And that’s just a snapshot of what we’ll be announcing at Ignite. As a reminder, you can view keynote sessions from Satya Nadella, Rajesh Jha and Jared Spataro, Charlie Bell and Vasu Jakkal, and Scott Guthrie live or on-demand.

"Startups to access high-performance Azure infrastructure, accelerating AI breakthroughs","
		Today Microsoft is updating its startup program to include a free Azure AI infrastructure option for high-end GPU virtual machine clusters, for use in training and running large language models and other deep learning models.
Y Combinator (YC) and its community of startup innovators will be the first to access this offering in private preview to a limited cohort. YC has an unmatched reputation as a pioneering startup accelerator helping launch transformative companies including Airbnb, Coinbase and Stripe. Now YC startups will have the technical resources they need to quickly prototype and bring to market cutting-edge AI innovations. Our close collaboration with YC provides valuable insights into the infrastructure needs of early-stage AI companies, ensuring our offering delivers optimal value to additional startups going forward.
“With the overwhelming infrastructure requirements needed to do AI at scale, we believe that providing startups with high-performance capabilities tailored for demanding AI workloads will empower our startups to ship faster,” said Michael Seibel, Managing Director of Y Combinator.
We are also working with M12, Microsoft’s venture fund, and the startups in M12’s portfolio which will gain access to these dedicated supercomputing resources to further empower their AI innovations.  Over time, our vision is to partner with additional startup investors and accelerators, with a goal of working with the ecosystem to lower the barrier to training and running AI models for any promising startup.
Microsoft Azure offers cloud-based scalable AI infrastructure, built for and with the world’s most sophisticated AI workloads, from delivering the largest and most complex AI models including GPT-4 and ChatGPT through Azure OpenAI Service to developers to infuse AI capabilities into many apps. Azure AI infrastructure is fueling groundbreaking innovations. Infrastructure requirements to do AI at scale are often overwhelming, but with Azure’s global infrastructure of AI-accelerated server offerings with networked graphics processing units (GPUs), startups building advanced AI systems will be able to leverage these high-performance capabilities to accelerate innovation.
On top of world-class infrastructure, we will also provide tools to simplify deployment and management through Azure Machine Learning. This enables easy low-code or code-based training of custom models and fine-tuning of frontier and open-source models, simplified deployment and optimizations like Low Rank Adaptation, DeepSpeed and ONNX Runtime (ORT).  Further, startups can deploy AI solutions with peace of mind knowing all deployments are secure and backed by Microsoft’s principles for Responsible AI.
Empowering startups to build transformative solutions powered by AI
AI is transforming industries and startups are leading that innovation, creating new business and societal value quicker than many thought possible. According to a recent KPMG survey, the near-term demand is real, with 75% of U.S. CEOs stating that generative AI is a top investment priority, 83% anticipating an increase in generative AI investment by more than 50% in the next year, and 45% saying investment will at least double. For startups, this represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring groundbreaking impact to a market hungry for change.
To help startups meet this opportunity, last year we introduced Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub – designed to help founders speed development with free access to GitHub and the Microsoft Cloud as well as unique benefits including free access to $2,500 of OpenAI credits to experiment and up to $150,000 in Azure credits that startups can apply to Azure OpenAI Service. Startups also receive 1:1 advice from Microsoft AI experts to help guide implementation. The Microsoft Pegasus Program, an extension of Founders Hub, links enterprise customers with startup solutions for immediate deployment. Seventy-five percent of Pegasus startups have landed deals with Fortune 1000 companies via increased reach across Azure Marketplace.
Startups using Azure AI to develop cutting-edge solutions for today’s problems
Whether you have a product in market or just an idea, Microsoft provides startups with the tools they need to rapidly build and scale AI solutions. Already, we are seeing the results of empowering startups to innovate with AI to improve customer support, detect and address health conditions and advance immersive gaming experiences. Here are just a few examples of the cutting-edge innovation happening now:
Commerce.AI dramatically increases call center productivity with Azure OpenAI Service
Commerce.AI uses Azure OpenAI Service and Azure AI Services to make call centers more efficient. Azure Cognitive Services uses a Commerce.AI model to transcribe interactions in real time, including into multiple languages. After the call, Azure OpenAI Service creates a summary with customer contact information, topics of conversation and embedded sentiment analysis. The system selects next steps and follow-up action items from pre-generated options, and the customer service agent exports the information to Microsoft Dynamics 365 in one quick step.
Inworld: The next-generation AI character engine for immersive gaming
Inworld, a Silicon Valley startup, is a fully integrated character engine that goes beyond language models to give users complete control over AI non-player characters (NPCs). With Inworld, users can customize their characters’ knowledge, memory, personality, emotions and narrative role. Inworld uses Azure AI technologies like Azure OpenAI Service to power its advanced natural language understanding and generation.

Honoring veterans and recognizing their value and contributions at Microsoft and beyond,"Microsoft honors service members and their families today and every day.

Since 1996, the month of November has been commemorated by presidential proclamation as National Veterans and Military Families Month in the United States with the observance of Veterans Day on the 11th as a central moment of celebration and appreciation. Throughout the month, you can expect to see American flags, camouflage and other patriotic or military decorations everywhere you look as communities celebrate one of our greatest national treasures: Our military veterans and those who make their service possible.

As a leader at Microsoft with deep personal appreciation for the military community that goes beyond my role as executive sponsor of the Military at Microsoft Employee Resource Group, I am grateful that this month is dedicated to honoring those who have answered the call to serve. The month provides an intentional reminder to step back and think about our veterans and all they contribute to our community and to our business. At Microsoft, we recognize the intrinsic value that veterans bring every day. The entrepreneurial mindset, team spirit and creativity that are cultivated out of necessity in ambiguous and often-challenging military operational environments are the same fundamental characteristics required to drive rapid innovation in technology. Across career stages and disciplines, the contributions and capabilities of our military veterans are clear.

While we are celebrating living veterans in the United States, other nations mark Nov. 11 as a moment for remembrance of those lost in war. That date in 1918 marked the end of hostilities and an initial step toward ending the First World War. In the years following the war, Armistice Day served as a moment for nations and people around the world to remember the sacrifice of their fallen service members and the heavy price that each nation paid with the hope of establishing an enduring peace. Great Britain, the Commonwealth and many countries across Europe continue to observe Nov. 11 as Remembrance Day or Poppy Day, a day dedicated to honoring fallen service members.

Honoring service past and present

At Microsoft, the week leading up to Veterans Day is filled with events focused on honoring, celebrating and expressing gratitude for veterans and military communities around the world both inside and outside of Microsoft. Along with these celebrations, I believe one of the best ways Microsoft continues to honor the service and sacrifice our veterans and their families willingly make on our behalf is to do its part — to provide the support they need to thrive while still in uniform and after they have hung up the uniform for the final time.

Meet a few of our remarkable veterans who continue to make a difference and embody Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.

Shannon Llenza, Assistant General Counsel

Shannon joined the United States Navy in March 2000 while she was in law school. Upon graduation in May 2001, she began active-duty service as a Judge Advocate General (JAG) officer.

After completing nearly five years of active-duty service, Shannon transitioned into the Navy Reserves in 2006 – where she continues to serve as a commander. She plans to retire in February 2024, after completing 20 years of service.

During her time in service, Shannon deployed to Camp Lemonier in Djibouti, Africa — the only permanent U.S. military base in Africa which supports a variety of missions and operations in the region.

She served as the legal advisor to the commanding officer of the base, providing legal counsel on a wide range of issues.

She shared that one highlight of the deployment was the opportunity to participate in the Grand Bara, which is a run across the Grand Bara Desert, Djibouti, with about 200 other service members.

Shannon was a full-time employee at Microsoft during her deployment to Africa. She shared that “Microsoft has a good program set up for service members who deploy and for reservists who must fulfill their commitment of drilling two weeks a year with their unit. Microsoft supports and values the contributions of its military employees, which allows them to fulfill their service without having to think about their employment while they are away.”

She has also been involved in the Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs (CELA) Military Employee Network since she started at Microsoft.

She said, “it has been a great way to meet people in the community and the network has been instrumental in providing resources and education on all things Microsoft for its members.”

For Shannon, her experience in the military has shaped how she approaches issues in her civilian career. “The military teaches you how to get things done, how to work in ambiguous environments, and how to step out of your comfort zone.”

Chas Jeffries, Principal Product Manager

Chas joined the U.S. Air Force in 1991, retiring on Oct. 29, 2023 after 30 years of service and achieving the rank of major general.

Entering service in the computer/communications officer career field, he served for six years on active duty in the Air Force before joining Microsoft and transitioning to the Air National Guard.

Chas said, “the experience I gained in the Air Force gave me a foundation in software engineering that enabled me to transition to civilian employment at a company like Microsoft.”

Joining Microsoft as a full-time employee in July 2000, Chas began serving in the Washington Air National Guard’s Information Warfare Team and continued to serve in the Air National Guard while working at Microsoft for 23 years.

Over the years, Chas experienced an incredible synergy between his roles at Microsoft and in the military. In both staff roles and in command, Chas has taken his knowledge of high-performing teams in the military and applied it to his civilian role.

Chas was part of the “start-up” team that would eventually form the foundation for Cyberspace Ops Squadrons and a Cyberspace Ops Group in the Washington Air National Guard. While serving in these units, Chas gained training and experience in information dominance and cybersecurity operations which he was able to directly apply to his work helping Microsoft build and launch sovereign clouds.

In addition to the experiences that he gained through leadership roles and operational roles, Chas said, “I’ve also benefited from a wealth of executive leadership training afforded to me. I’ve had the opportunity to attend Department of Defense-sponsored executive leadership courses at Harvard and MIT on topics including national cybersecurity policy and AI.”

Chas was deployed with the Air National Guard to Afghanistan in 2008 and with U.S. Forces Korea for multiple 30-day deployments between 2014 and 2017. When asked about the ways Microsoft has supported him as he continued to serve while working as a fulltime employee, Chas said that “Microsoft is an industry leader in its support of military members who chose to continue to serve.”
For Chas, the robust Military at Microsoft Employee Resource Group community has provided him with tremendous support.

He also recognizes the incredible impact of Microsoft’s Military Affairs organization which provides an invaluable resource to military veterans and current service members. Like many teams at Microsoft, Chas has benefited directly by hiring amazing veterans from the hiring and skilling programs the company supports.

Supporting the military community at Microsoft and beyond

As a company, we endeavor to honor the commitment to service that Shannon, Chas and others like them demonstrate through our commitment to train, hire and support our veterans and their families. In addition to supporting employees who continue to serve in reserve components, Microsoft also dedicates resources to help service members transition into careers in tech through mentorship, skilling programs and fellowships.

This year, the Military Affairs team at Microsoft is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) by featuring 10 tech professionals who got their start with MSSA and continue to make an incredible impact in the industry today. MSSA is a 17-week training program for veterans and transitioning service members for high-demand careers in cloud development or cloud administration. Program participants have an opportunity to engage directly with Microsoft recruiters, connect with alumni and receive resources and education on Microsoft roles, how to apply and the overall hiring process. Historically, this program made a tremendous impact with over 3,600 graduates and 98% of those graduates are employed or pursuing continuing education. The Military Affairs team continues to look for ways to best serve the community and recently announced new benefits for alumni and a resource center for MSSA alumni as part of their 10th anniversary celebration. I look forward to seeing how MSSA and other programs Microsoft offers for the military community will grow and continue making an impact for service members and their families.

As an executive sponsor of the Military at Microsoft Employee Resource Group, I have the distinct honor of serving our incredible global military community within Microsoft. In this capacity as well as in my business leadership role, I am fortunate to work alongside members of the military community and bear witness to their incredible ongoing impact within our organizations. The unique qualities and values that compel individuals like Shannon and Chas to serve their country are the same that make them invaluable members of the Microsoft team. Selfless service is one of the most noticeable traits of the ethos that follows veterans wherever they go, and you can see it in their dedication to team and mission above self.

To our veterans: Today, and every day, thank you.

New study validates the business value and opportunity of AI,"As AI becomes more woven into society, its economic impact will be significant, and organizations are just starting to understand the extent of what’s possible. For companies to invest in AI though, it must make good business sense. Business leaders and decision makers need to understand the industry and line-of-business use cases that are best positioned to drive value within their organizations, what the return on investment will be, what time to value to expect, and how to get started. In short, they need help demystifying the business case for AI.   

To help companies understand the opportunities AI can unlock, Microsoft commissioned a study through IDC that provides unique insights into how AI is being used to drive economic impact for organizations. IDC surveyed over 2,000 business leaders and decision makers from around the world who are responsible for bringing AI transformation to life within their organizations. The study, which builds on the results from Microsoft’s Work Trend Index focused on workplace productivity, examines how companies are monetizing their AI investments, from generating new revenue streams to delivering differentiated customer experiences, to modernizing internal processes. Key findings from this study show*: 

71% of respondents say their companies are already using AI 
92% of AI deployments are taking 12 months or less 
Organizations are realizing a return on their AI investments within 14 months 
For every $1 a company invests in AI, it is realizing an average return of $3.5X  
52% report that a lack of skilled workers is their biggest barrier to implement and scale AI   

The study illustrates that AI has demonstrable business value, and we are seeing this surface in core use cases within areas like employee experience, customer engagement and internal business processes, and how AI can help bend the curve on innovation. With generative AI, that value gets exponentially greater, as we’ve seen in the past year with generative AI technologies from OpenAI such as ChatGPT.  

“IDC is projecting that generative AI will add nearly $10 trillion to global GDP over the next 10 years.** Calculating the value of new investments in GenAI requires building the business case by simulating potential cost and responsible value realization,” said Ritu Jyoti, Group Vice President AI and Automation for IDC.    

This wave of innovation has accelerated the pace of AI adoption in ways that are changing and augmenting how we work and live, and Microsoft customers are increasingly embracing AI opportunities for business transformation. 

Enrich employee experiences: Employees in every industry are dealing with an increasing volume of digital debt and administrative burdens that slow down productivity and get in the way of meaningful work. To address this challenge, AI is being used to bring together unstructured data like social media, product details and customer engagement to better tailor communications, enable more intelligent insights and solve problems faster. Additionally, employees are using Azure OpenAI and Microsoft Copilot in Microsoft 365 to augment their copywriting capabilities for things like presentations, website content, case studies, blogs, press releases, search engine optimization and digital art.  

Reinvent customer engagement: With the heavy competition for customer acquisitions and retention, organizations have struggled to keep pace with the increasing amount of customer signals, and to deliver personalized service to customers in real-time. To drive greater customer loyalty, organizations are applying the AI capabilities of Dynamics 365 in contact centers for real-time assistance and guidance on suggested responses. Employees are also using AI to summarize conversations, guide on next steps, and get coaching feedback. Azure-powered virtual assistants are being used to deliver all kinds of hyper-personalized experiences across different verticals like healthcare for processing claims and entertainment for sports fans. Salespeople are using Viva Sales to help nurture leads and close deals. 


Reshape business processes: Companies have pockets of valuable information scattered throughout their organization that can be difficult for employees to locate and use holistically. By finding and making connections across this information, AI can surface integrated insights that help to predict and accelerate workloads. This is particularly evident in cybersecurity, where employees are using AI insights to identify bad actors more quickly and better protect both employees and intellectual property. AI is also being used in manufacturing and operations, to create digital replicas of their supply chain environments so they can run simulations and optimize workflow management, resulting in enhanced supply chain efficiency.  

Bend the curve on innovation: This is an exciting concept as companies in every industry look to regain an edge. Organizations can deploy AI to stay ahead of changing business dynamics, and to exceed customer expectations. By not having to modernize every underlying system to achieve these results, and by putting AI directly in the hands of developers with GitHub Copilot, organizations can operate with agility and accelerate innovation.  Teams can leverage AI to help scale production and speed to market while being able to focus on higher-value activities.  

IDC survey data confirms that businesses are eager to adopt AI technology, with 71% of survey respondents currently using AI tools in their organizations, and 22% planning to do so within the next 12 months. However, even with this momentum and positive outlook for what AI can help them achieve, organizations are facing challenges when it comes to implementation. A shortage of skilled employees is holding companies back from accelerating their AI-based innovations, with 52 percent of those surveyed reporting a lack of skilled workers needed to implement and scale AI initiatives across business functions as the top blocker.  

To help address the skilling gap, Microsoft has already engaged over 6 million people globally in learning activities in the last 12 months and has ambitions to provide skills to everyone using our AI technology. We have also empowered our ecosystem of more than 400,000 partners worldwide with the skills needed to implement AI technology responsibly and to deliver greater customer value.    

No matter where you are in your cloud and AI transformation journey, Microsoft can help. To learn more about how customers across industries are shaping their AI transformation with Microsoft, please visit the Microsoft Cloud blog which shares real-world examples of business impact being driven by AI, as well as resources and skilling opportunities you can use to build your readiness to lead the era of AI.  

 

 

About the study
The IDC study, commissioned by Microsoft, is based on results from 2,109 enterprise organizations totaling more than 13 million employees worldwide across 16 countries globally. Through the questionnaire, respondents were identified as the decision maker for AI within their organization.

"Microsoft’s 2023 Diversity and Inclusion Report: A decade of transparency, commitment and progress","
		Today, I am sharing Microsoft’s 2023 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report — our fifth consecutive annual report and the 10th year of releasing our global workforce demographic data. As we mark this milestone, a couple of key aspects about our company’s work on diversity and inclusion (D&I) stand out: Our journey is ever evolving, and our focus and progress are consistent, both of which are vital to delivering on Microsoft’s mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
This year’s report shows that we continue to be a more diverse Microsoft today than we have ever been. Looking at this year’s data as well as our cumulative efforts, it’s clear that we are driving positive change. The data we share is also a powerful tool for us to understand with precision where we need to concentrate and accelerate our work. This year, amid an evolving macroeconomic environment, our company — like many others — made intentional organizational and workforce adjustments to meet the strategic demands of the business, which impacted our rate of progress in some areas. While there’s more work to be done, I am motivated by our ongoing progress and sustained efforts on increasing representation and strengthening a culture of inclusion, as detailed in this year’s report.
Key highlights

The representation of women and most racial and ethnic minority groups (Asian, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latinx, and multiracial employees) has increased at all levels over the past five years.
We maintained or grew representation within several leadership levels for women and U.S. racial and ethnic minority groups year over year.

The representation of women in Executive roles is 29.1%, a 3.2 percentage point increase year over year. This was the highest year-over-year Executive representation growth across women, men, and U.S. racial and ethnic groups in 2023.
The number of Black and African American Directors, Partners and Executives (including People Managers and Individual Contributors) rose to 107.8% of our 2025 Racial Equity Initiative commitment, up from 92.0% in 2022.
The number of Hispanic and Latinx Directors, Partners and Executives (including People Managers and Individual Contributors) increased to 74.8% of our 2025 Racial Equity Initiative commitment, up from 57.6% in 2022.


While hiring volume slowed, hiring representation was greater than or equal to representation for women and all racial and ethnic minority groups except Native American and Alaska Native.
At Microsoft, we are committed to the principle of pay equity, which accounts for factors that legitimately influence total pay including things like job title, level and tenure. As of September 2023:

Inside the U.S., all racial and ethnic minority groups who are rewards-eligible combined earn $1.007 total pay for every $1.000 earned by U.S. rewards-eligible white employees with the same job title and level and considering tenure.
Inside the U.S., women who are rewards-eligible earn $1.007 total pay for every $1.000 earned by rewards-eligible employees who are men and have the same job title and level, and considering tenure; outside the U.S., women who are rewards-eligible earn $1.003 total pay for every $1.000 earned by rewards-eligible employees who are men and have the same job title and level, and considering tenure.


Last year, we began voluntarily disclosing median unadjusted pay analysis, which gathers the total pay amounts for all employees across a company — regardless of factors such as job title, level or tenure — sorts those amounts by value, and then identifies the number that’s in the middle, or median, of all of those data points. The difference between that median pay amount for any two employee groups is referred to as a median unadjusted pay gap.

As of September 2023, our analysis shows that we have made progress in narrowing the median unadjusted pay gap for women in the U.S., women outside of the U.S., and Asian, Black and African American, and Hispanic and Latinx employees in the U.S.
As we continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minority groups at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will continue to reduce.



New data
Hires data: As one of the most transparent companies of our size when it comes to the diversity and inclusion data we share, we are continually evaluating where we are now and where we aim to be. That is why, in addition to the extensive data we already share, we’re reporting on external hires representation for women and men globally and race and ethnicity in the U.S. for the first time. This data reflects the hires of members of a particular group as a percentage of total employee hires within the respective fiscal year. Hires representation being higher than headcount representation is one of the factors that could increase a group’s representation in the workforce. This past fiscal year, hires representation was greater than headcount representation for women as well as Asian, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latinx, and multiracial employees.
Self-ID data: At Microsoft, Self-ID helps us recognize the different identities, experiences and needs of the entire workforce. Through voluntary Self-ID, employees can help Microsoft make better-informed, more inclusive decisions about meaningful benefits and programs that meet their needs in various stages of life, flex to their interests, and enrich their lives. Self-ID is available globally in 46 markets with some variation, as dictated by local laws, practices and customs. We continue to evolve self-identification options for employees to be as inclusive as possible.
This year, we’re sharing more self-identification (Self-ID) data on Asian sub-identities in the U.S. to further highlight the importance of identity and the impact of self-identification. This comes after expanding the options for Asian employees in the U.S. who want to identify their backgrounds in additional detail last year. The Asian community is the single largest racial and ethnic minority group within our company, with more than 20 sub-identities.
Employee survey data
In addition to our demographic data, we share employee survey data in our D&I report each year, which helps us assess the impact of our D&I efforts so we can better understand how to close the gap between the culture of inclusion we aspire to and the lived experiences of everyone at Microsoft. We have continued to invest in experiences, behavior and organization changes, as well as prioritization of retention and development. This year, meaningful insights include:

This year, 96.4% of employees reported some level of awareness of the concept of allyship, which is a cornerstone of our growth mindset approach to D&I. This is up from 90.3% in 2022 and 65.0% in 2019, when we first started asking employees about their awareness.
The average score for the survey question asking employees if they understand what is expected of them to contribute to a more diverse and inclusive environment increased from 82 to 84 globally year over year, and from 80 to 83 in the U.S. Additionally, the average score increased year over year for men, women and every racial and ethnic group.

Inclusion spotlights
While data is important, it does not tell the whole story. Through six Inclusion Spotlights, this year’s report shares more details on some of the people, programs and initiatives that demonstrate how we invest in and innovate for D&I.

Global strategy, local implementation: We explore how the global Microsoft workforce activated around D&I this past year in ways relevant and meaningful to local employees and communities to drive positive change.
Inclusion from the start: We shine a spotlight on New Employee Orientation (NEO) as well as the Nuance acquisition and explore ways we introduce a culture of inclusion to new employees or integrate companies we acquire into our inclusive culture.
Self-expression in our products: We connect how technical and D&I expertise come together to inform new self-expression tools, including profile videos, pronouns and name pronunciation.
Innovative learning: We delve into some of our learning offerings, informed by a range of communities and experts, that enable employees to deepen their understanding and take intentional action for meaningful progress.
D&I Core Priority: We share the evolution and impact of the D&I Core Priority, an accountability approach that sets Microsoft apart.
AI & D&I: We look at how we build trust through our responsible AI strategy and inclusive AI solutions.

As we look ahead, we are unwavering in our focus to attract, develop and retain a workforce that reflects a diversity of backgrounds, skills and experiences. We support employees’ careers through intentional talent management, access and career mobility across all levels of our organization. To further support this, our team and my role have recently evolved to include talent development efforts in addition to global D&I work. This organizational alignment allows us to further embed D&I into all our talent practices in an effort to accelerate representation progress.
We believe our continued work to build diverse workforces and strengthen our culture of inclusion helps foster innovation and serve our business and customer needs. I am confident that our combined momentum and commitment will only fuel additional ways for us to leverage our resources with intention, driving progress toward a more diverse and inclusive Microsoft.

Microsoft introduces new data and AI solutions to help healthcare organizations unlock insights and improve patient and clinician experiences,"Every industry depends on unique insights to achieve their goals, and unlocking the power of data is the key to an organization’s success. This is especially true in healthcare, where data has the potential to do so much good – from improving health outcomes and enhancing patient and clinician experiences to driving better organizational performance for healthcare systems. When a patient’s or the population’s health is at the center of the decision-making process, having the right data strategy in place can have a life-changing impact on people’s lives.

Healthcare data continues to grow rapidly, and organizations are struggling to keep up with higher volume, greater variety and increased velocity. According to the World Economic Forum, hospitals produce 50 petabytes of siloed data per year – that’s equivalent to approximately 10 billion music files. Ninety-seven percent of this data goes unused, leaving many valuable insights locked away. Putting all this data to good use is the key to unlocking clinical and operational breakthroughs that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients and their healthcare journey. And in the new era of AI, the importance of data continues to grow as organizations realize that without a solid data strategy, they are only scratching the surface of what’s possible with AI.

At the HLTH 2023 conference, we’re introducing new data and AI solutions and capabilities that will help healthcare organizations stay focused on improving patient and clinician experiences while delivering quality care more efficiently and at a lower cost. Together, these new solutions offer healthcare organizations a unified, safe and responsible approach to their data and AI strategy and enable them to take advantage of the breadth and scale of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.

Unifying data analytics to drive business value and better patient care
In May of this year, we unveiled Microsoft Fabric – an end-to-end, unified analytics platform that brings together all the data and analytics tools that organizations need to unlock the potential of their data and lay the foundation for the era of AI. Today, through the power of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, we are introducing the first industry-specific data solutions in Fabric that unify data and insights through one common architecture and experience. Now available in preview, the healthcare data solutions in Fabric eliminate the costly, time-consuming process of stitching together a complex set of disconnected, multimodal health data sources – text, images, video, etc. – and provides a secure and governed way for organizations to access, analyze and visualize data-driven insights across their organization.

Microsoft Fabric gives healthcare organizations:

The ability to combine data from previously siloed sources across their organization, such as electronic health records (EHRs), Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS), labs systems, claims systems and medical devices. The solution brings structured, unstructured, imaging and medical device data into the Fabric data lake with open data standards using FHIR, DICOM and MedTech services, providing customers with one common architecture. Additionally, connectors and converters make it easier to transform FHIR, DICOM and MedTech data from one format to another or build pipelines for specific use cases.
A multimodal data foundation that allows them to build standardized, scalable solutions that help accelerate the process of uncovering impactful clinical and operational insights and ultimately drive better patient care. Fabric helps create a single data estate where health data can live and be used to build and run AI models, as well as derive insights.
Standard capabilities like Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) analytics enable clinical research and patient outreach analytics help provide more personalized engagement with patients.
A new de-identification service will allow organizations to de-identify clinical data, keeping patient-protected health information (PHI) private by using machine learning models to extract, redact or surrogate identifiers while unlocking insights from unstructured data, such as doctor’s notes, medical documents and clinical trial studies.
In addition, through healthcare-specific pre-built classification rules, labels and data glossaries in Microsoft Purview (preview), healthcare organizations can govern, protect and manage their entire data estate.

Organizations across the healthcare spectrum can benefit from Microsoft Fabric, with early adopters already planning to leverage the analytics platform to help advance some of their most prominent use cases:

Northwestern Medicine, Chicago’s premier integrated academic health system, will leverage the healthcare data solutions in Fabric to integrate clinical data across a variety of sources, meet regulatory mandates for information exchange, and unlock insights with data and AI, helping further their patients-first mission with high quality and timely care.
Arthur Health plans to use Fabric to power predictive care stage models in partnership with Quisitive for the Ontario Workers Network (OWN). OWN is a provincial network of hospitals, including Ottawa Hospital, and has experienced clinicians that provide world-class care for workers in their own communities.
SingHealth, Singapore’s largest network of public healthcare institutions, aims to harness the power of Fabric’s healthcare data solutions for its underlying data infrastructure. This will help to transform the delivery of healthcare to provide excellent care and services to the population and patients, empowering them to take care of their own health and healthcare.

New AI capabilities that empower patients and simplify medical jargon
Within Azure AI services, we are releasing new healthcare capabilities that will help organizations maximize the value of AI to increase positive impact on patient outcomes:

Helping clinicians and researchers make informed decisions – Azure AI Health Insights is a cognitive service that provides prebuilt models that perform analysis and provide inferences that can be reviewed and used by clinicians and researchers to facilitate patient care during important healthcare scenarios.

We are launching three new models in preview, including patient timeline, which uses generative AI to extract key events from unstructured data, such as medications, diagnosis and procedures, and organizes them chronologically to give clinicians a more accurate view of a patient’s medical history to better inform care plans. Clinical report simplification uses generative AI to give clinicians the ability to take medical jargon and convert it into simple language while preserving the full essence of the clinical information so that it can be shared with others, including patients. Radiology insights provides quality checks through feedback on errors and inconsistencies. The model also identifies follow-up recommendations and clinical findings within clinical documentation with measurements (sizes) documented by the radiologist.

Bringing generative AI to healthcare chatbots and virtual assistants – This new preview capability in Azure AI Health Bot provides out-the-box healthcare intelligence that can be customized and connected into existing workflows, using answers from a healthcare organization’s own content sources, as well as leveraging generative AI to provide answers from credible sources like the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Extracting and labeling medical data to identify meaningful insights – Text Analytics for health, an Azure AI Language service, applies machine learning intelligence to extract and label essential medical information from a variety of unstructured texts. Newly released industry open source templates include population health, patient population Q&A using Azure OpenAI Service, clinical trials patient cohorts and mass historic data processing.

AI-powered solutions empower clinicians to deliver quality, personalized care
U.S. health systems are turning to AI-powered solutions to alleviate administrative burden and the resulting clinician burnout, which rose to 53% among physicians in 2023 compared to 42% in 2018, according to Medscape’s 2023 survey. To address this burnout, and empower clinicians to focus on delivering high-quality personalized care, we announced the general availability of Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX™) Copilot, formerly known as DAX Express.

DAX Copilot, part of the larger Nuance Dragon family of solutions used by more than 550,000 users worldwide, allows clinicians to create draft clinical summaries automatically and securely in seconds from exam room or telehealth conversations for immediate review and entry in the EHR.

Atrium Health was the first to deploy Nuance DAX Copilot to its primary care physicians with plans for a broad rollout across its footprint. Physicians are already reporting saving meaningful time in their documentation tasks for each patient visit. In particular, Atrium Health clinicians are reporting that physicians are already saving up to 40 minutes per day with this advanced documentation technology.

Unlocking global government innovation with Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty – public preview available today,"The Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty represents a significant advancement at the intersection of global demand for innovation and evolving national policies regarding data privacy and control. It ushers in a new era for governments worldwide, providing a secure avenue for modernizing their technology infrastructure and workflows.

Today, we are announcing public preview of the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty. Furthermore, we are announcing our planned general availability of the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty for this December. This solution will enable governments to meet their compliance, security and policy requirements while harnessing the cloud to deliver value to their citizens.

Since the inception of the cloud, government customers have faced limitations with digital transformation, in part because of the need for controls to meet specific national and regional requirements. Over recent years, innovators within global governments have asked for alternatives to the heavy capital expense and operational costs of a legacy approach, both to reduce the overhead of owning and operating datacenters and to facilitate modernization. Additionally, evolving policy decisions such as the European Commission’s EU-U.S. Adequacy Decision in July 2023 under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now provide legal support for continued adoption of hyperscale cloud computing by government customers within the EU.

With these two trends converging in the public sector, and with specific requirements varying by country, Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is grounded in a repeatable best-practice approach that can be leveraged to assist with complex regulation achievements. This solution features industry-leading data sovereignty and encryption controls, enabling governments to easily create solutions tailored to help address regional and national requirements.

A principled approach to digital sovereignty

At Microsoft, we believe in transparency so that people and organizations can control their data and have meaningful choices in how it’s used. We empower and defend the data privacy choices of every person who uses our products and services.

Our principled approach to digital sovereignty in the cloud builds on our principled approach to data privacy in the cloud. We understand that sovereignty can mean different things for different scenarios, and as we work with customers and partners around the world the common thread is a need to determine for themselves where their data resides and how it’s protected, including who has access to that data.

For most government needs, the security, privacy and compliance capabilities of the Microsoft Cloud already deliver on their requirements, regulations and standards — the additional capabilities we’re providing with the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty are designed specifically for countries with jurisdictional requirements around sensitive data. With all Microsoft Cloud solutions, customers benefit from industry-leading cybersecurity, along with the broadest compliance and more regions than any other cloud provider.

A keystone offering for national requirements

Our collaboration with partners who deeply understand national requirements enables us to provide a global solution for local requirements. These requirements are often complex due to a layered landscape of evolving policy, trends and regulations. The solutions Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty delivers have been validated by governments and their partners as a preferred way to unlock cloud value.

In the United Arab Emirates, G42 enables the UAE public sector and regulated industries clients to use new platform capabilities for securing data and workloads, providing access to the latest cloud and AI features available on Azure and helping them comply with local privacy and regulatory requirements.
In Italy, Leonardo is part of the consortium that delivers the Polo Strategico Nazionale (PSN), which translates as “National Strategic Hub,” that aims to provide a centralized, secure and compliant set of cloud services for public administrations in Italy, ranging from central entities like the ministries, down to regional and local governments such as health agencies and Leonardo is using Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty to deliver solutions for multiple customers that leverage the economies of scale, security levels and pace of innovation that today are only available with hyperscale clouds.
According to recent research from Accenture, European enterprises are increasingly embracing sovereign cloud, with 37% already invested and 44% planning to invest in the next two years. With 137 countries enacting some form of data protection and sovereignty laws, Accenture can use Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty to support governments with a sound sovereign cloud strategy to establish control of their data while unlocking new sources of value in the digital realm.
Landing tailored policies with sovereign controls

Our intent with the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty is to unlock cloud innovation for governments through tailored sovereign controls, and our technical approach is grounded in repeatable best practices designed to help customers achieve their regional and national requirements.

With the start of the public preview today, we’re releasing:

The Sovereign Landing Zone and policy initiative now available on GitHub, which instantiates guardrails for sovereign cloud environments for customer workloads, enabling customers to leverage best practices for secure and consistent environments while supporting their efforts to meet evolving local regulations.

"Microsoft and Epic expand AI collaboration to accelerate generative AI’s impact in healthcare, addressing the industry’s most pressing needs","Getty Images

Today, the promise of technology to help us solve some of the biggest challenges we face has never been more tangible, and nowhere is generative AI more needed, and possibly more impactful, than in healthcare. Epic and Microsoft have been paving the way to bring generative AI to the forefront of the healthcare industry. Together, we are working to help clinicians better serve their patients and are addressing some of the most urgent needs, from workforce burnout to staffing shortages.

We combined Microsoft’s large-scale cloud and AI technologies with Epic’s deep understanding of the healthcare industry and clinical workflows to address many current issues affecting clinicians. Today, we are announcing the expansion of our strategic initiative to bring AI to healthcare at scale, integrating conversational, ambient and generative AI technologies across the Epic electronic health record (EHR) ecosystem. Intended to speed development of solutions for healthcare’s most critical needs, the initiative will expand secure access to AI-powered clinical insights and administrative tools within a wide range of Epic modules to enhance patient care, increase operational efficiency, improve healthcare experiences, and support the financial integrity of health systems globally.

We are working together to rapidly deploy dozens of copilot solutions that securely unlock the potential value that the Microsoft Cloud and our AI technologies enable as health systems strive to overcome the urgent staffing, financial and clinical access challenges they face today. Epic will showcase many of these new capabilities that build on our Azure OpenAI Service and Nuance DAX Express solutions at its annual Users Group Meeting today, including:

Enhancing clinician productivity with note summarization: Building on the previously announced AI-assisted Epic In Basket, the new solutions are targeted at increasing clinical efficiency for physicians and nurses, helping them become more productive in their daily clinical workflow. The solutions will help support faster documentation through suggested text and rapid review with in-context summaries.
Enhancing clinician productivity with embedded ambient clinical documentation: Leveraging Nuance’s Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) technology, which is already deployed with hundreds of Epic customers and currently supporting thousands of physicians, Epic will showcase this DAX Express AI technology embedded into the native Epic Hyperdrive platform and Haiku mobile application, further enhancing a seamless workflow experience for users. In addition, Nuance has been named by Epic as one of the first Partners in Epic’s Partner and Pals third-party vendor program.
Driving administrative efficiencies through reduction in manual, labor intensive processes: Revenue cycle management is one of many areas where generative AI can meaningfully improve efficiency. For example, Epic will demonstrate an AI-powered solution that provides medical coding staff with suggestions based on clinical documentation in the EHR to improve accuracy and streamline the entire coding and billing processes.
Advancing medicine for better patient outcomes: By using Azure OpenAI Service, Epic is now delivering generative AI exploration for an initial set of users via SlicerDicer to fill gaps in clinical evidence using real-world data and to study rare diseases and more.

Our work to integrate Azure OpenAI Service and Nuance ambient technologies within the Epic ecosystem shows that broader strategic collaborations can rapidly accelerate the availability of actionable AI-driven solutions for healthcare organizations and the patients they serve.

By 2025, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services predicts that there will be a nationwide shortage of 90,000 physicians. Additionally, 40% to 60% of clinicians report they are experiencing burnout. On top of these challenges, healthcare providers are facing financial pressures while also trying to efficiently and effectively deliver quality care. According to McKinsey & Company, nearly a quarter of U.S. national health expenditure goes toward administrative costs, which could be reduced through technology.

Additionally, the urgent need to improve operational and clinical efficiency was highlighted again in a recent UPMC Center for Connected Medicine/KLAS Research survey of 58 executives at provider and payor organizations. The survey found that health systems are prioritizing investments over the next two years in AI solutions focusing on operational optimization, health/disease management and prediction, diagnostic imaging, population health management, value-based care, patient engagement and clinical research.

Epic and Microsoft’s expanded collaboration will build upon our recently announced integrations, including Azure OpenAI Service into Epic’s EHR to automatically draft message responses, as well as a solution that will bring natural language queries and interactive data analysis to SlicerDicer, Epic’s self-service reporting tool. Microsoft and Nuance also recently collaborated to integrate Nuance® Dragon® Ambient eXperience™ Express (DAX Express™) solution into the Epic platform with a comprehensive approach to incorporating a broader array of AI-powered capabilities for clinical and administrative users.

Epic’s approach to leveraging Microsoft’s technology and infrastructure is unprecedented in time and scope. Together, we are bringing generative AI to healthcare at scale as quickly as possible, responsibly and in partnership with providers, in order to address the ongoing issues affecting healthcare.

Microsoft solutions boost Fortune 500 frontline productivity with next-generation AI,"
		Frontline workers represent the face of organizations and make up the lion’s share of the workforce. Gartner estimates that there are 2.7 billion frontline workers — more than twice the number of desk-based workers.i The current macroeconomic climate highlighted by labor and supply chain shortages has put a lot of pressure on these workers to carry more work as organizations drive efficiency across business operations.
The recent Work Trend Index shows that there is an opportunity for digital tools to help ease the burden on these essential workers. Over 60% of frontline workers struggle with having to do repetitive or menial tasks that take time away from more meaningful work and not having enough of the necessary resources to get their work done efficiently.ii In addition, 1 in 2 frontline workers cite being burned out in their jobs, and 45% note they are likely to consider changing employers in the next year.ii Investment in technology that enables frontline workers to thrive is a huge opportunity for business leaders – one that will drive positive outcomes for employees, customers, and the bottom line if solved correctly.
Today, over 60% of the Fortune 500 use Microsoft 365 to empower frontline workers. Microsoft is committed to investing in innovative solutions to help frontline workers thrive. With AI transforming productivity across most segments of the workforce, our survey found that 65% of frontline workers are optimistic that AI will help them in their jobs.ii.
We are excited to introduce new tools and integrations including bringing the power of next-generation AI to the frontline across three key areas:

Intelligent operations
Effortless communication
Trusted experiences

These innovations will improve efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and enable faster decision making.

Intelligent operations
Whether it’s for an inspection, installation or a maintenance request, frontline service managers want to spend their time helping their team deliver exceptional service operations and not on inefficient tasks like copying and pasting information from one system to another. We seek to infuse the productivity applications frontline managers use everyday with the robust data and intelligence of underlying business applications. This helps streamline the frontline experience and drive efficiency with operations.

Copilot in Dynamics 365 Field Service with Outlook and Microsoft Teams integrations brings the power of next-generation AI to service professionals on the frontline. Frontline service managers who receive customer escalations in Outlook or Microsoft Teams can use Copilot in Dynamics 365 to streamline work order creation with relevant details pre-populated from emails or chats, optimize technician scheduling with data-driven recommendations based on factors such as travel time, availability and skillset, as well as generate draft responses to customer messages summarizing next steps without switching apps.
Dynamics 365 Field Service app in Microsoft Teams will enable frontline technicians to access key work order functionality in their flow of work. Technicians will now be able to see upcoming work orders at a glance in their home experience in Teams, share full work order details and easily access Dynamics 365 Remote Assist in one click to troubleshoot with remote experts in real time if they need additional support to complete jobs.

Maintaining end-to-end visibility on operations can be time-consuming for frontline managers with fluctuating team schedules and often a large, dispersed team. Soon Microsoft 365 Copilot can ground prompts and retrieve insights for frontline managers, leveraging data from the Shifts app with a new Shifts plugin for Microsoft 365 Copilot, in addition to user and company data it has access to such as Teams chat history, SharePoint, emails and more. This will enable frontline managers to quickly get a list of important items specific to their team and location to speed up time-consuming tasks like covering shifts and onboarding new employees.
Effortless communication
Workplace culture is built upon a connection to the company mission, and it all starts with strong lines of communication. When companies establish an easy way to access consistent communications, frontline workers feel informed and connected. With a single communications platform to reach their entire workforce, corporate communicators don’t have to switch out of their digital workspace to connect to the frontline.

Announcements in Viva Connections enables corporate communicators to draft, schedule and target important announcements like urgent communications, role-specific updates and safety policy changes to frontline workers. Communicators can quickly send messages directly from Viva Connections without having to leave Teams. Messages are delivered to the frontline through push notifications on their mobile devices and announcement cards in their Teams home experience.
To build a sense of belonging and purpose across your entire workforce, Targeted Campaigns in Viva Engage enables communicators to create campaigns that promote company-wide initiatives targeted to frontline audiences.

Trusted experiences
Many on the frontline work across multiple devices and often hand them over after a shift ends. To enable shift and part-time workers to be productive from the moment they log in, Windows 365 Frontline makes it easy and affordable to extend the power of Cloud PCs to employees on the frontline so they can securely access their personalized Windows experience on any device, no matter where they work.
Securing data across shared devices, while still ensuring a seamless end-user experience can be challenging. A digital identity allows frontline workers to access and move between the technology needed to do their work, whether they are on a shared device or a dedicated one.

For organizations using Intune, they can use Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) to enable a single sign-in and sign-out experience for Teams, Outlook, Power Apps and more with shared device mode for Android and iOS devices. This allows frontline workers to wipe their device quickly and compliantly for the next shift.
And organizations using SOTI or VMware Workspace ONE as their endpoint management solution can now also enroll Android devices in Microsoft Entra ID with shared device mode.

At Microsoft, we believe that technology can be a powerful force to reimagine how work gets done. By investing in innovative solutions for the frontline workforce, we are helping to drive positive change for frontline employees, customers and the bottom line. Frontline innovations across Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, Windows 365 Frontline, Intune and partner endpoint management solutions push the boundaries of what is possible and work toward a brighter future for all.

Accelerating scientific discovery with Azure Quantum,"Today, Microsoft is announcing new advances to Azure Quantum aimed at accelerating scientific discovery.

From the Iron Age revolutionizing agriculture to the Silicon Age revolutionizing how we communicate, new materials have always created inflection points for societal progress. Advances in this space will be transformative. For example, the transportation industry can develop more efficient and powerful batteries.  Pharmaceutical researchers can develop new drugs. The chemistry industry will be able to discover safer and more sustainable compounds for the products we use daily, like electronics, paints and textiles. And most importantly, scientists will be able to solve society’s most pressing challenges like reversing climate change and addressing food insecurity.

However, understanding nature is not an easy task. For accurate calculations of the most complex quantum states of molecules, the number of energy states of just 100 electrons can exceed the number of atoms in the visible universe.

Now, with a new generation of AI, the world’s most advanced AI models are coming together with our universal user interface – natural language – and nature’s foundational language – chemistry – ushering in a new era of scientific discovery. And that’s just the first step as we prepare for an even bigger transformation ahead of us: quantum supercomputing.

Innovators can start experimenting with the world’s best quantum hardware in Azure Quantum and get ready to solve more complex problems when quantum supercomputing becomes a reality. We are fast approaching the time when scientists and businesses will be able to solve previously intractable problems to unlock growth and human progress.

Today, we are introducing three advances in Azure Quantum towards this vision. 

1. Azure Quantum Elements

Azure Quantum Elements accelerates scientific discovery by integrating the latest breakthroughs in high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence and quantum computing.

With Azure Quantum Elements, scientists and product developers can:

Reduce time to impact and costs by accelerating the R&D pipeline and bringing innovative products to market more quickly, with some customers seeing a six-month to one-week speed up from project kick-off to solution.
Dramatically increase the search space for new materials, with the potential to scale from thousands of candidates to tens of millions.
Speed up certain chemistry simulations by 500,000 times, which is like compressing a year into one minute.
Get ready for scaled quantum computing by addressing quantum chemistry problems today with AI and HPC, while experimenting with existing quantum hardware and getting priority access to Microsoft’s quantum supercomputer in the future.

Using this comprehensive system, researchers can make advances in chemistry and materials science with unprecedented scale, speed and accuracy.

Scale. Scientists can understand the complex reactions needed to produce a product, find new candidates, and optimize the entire process. For example, scientists can now use Azure Quantum Elements to explore 1.5 million potential configurations in complex reactions comprised of 50,000 elementary steps. Early adopters are already using this massive scale to find more sustainable replacements for use in many everyday products, or entirely new products for innovative scenarios.

Speed. Azure Quantum Elements accelerates simulation by incorporating Microsoft’s specialized AI models for chemistry, which we trained on millions of chemistry and materials data points.  We based these models on the same breakthrough technologies you see elsewhere with generative AI. While Copilot understands the language of humans, Azure Quantum Elements also understands the language of nature – chemistry.

Accuracy. Today, scientists are using unique AI models and HPC scale to run simulations with higher levels of accuracy not available before. Azure Quantum Elements also integrates classical and quantum computing to provide an on-ramp to even greater simulation accuracy. In the future, scientists believe a quantum supercomputer will enable predictive chemical design at 100X accuracy.

Industry innovators, including BASF, AkzoNobel, AspenTech, Johnson Matthey, SCGC, and 1910 Genetics have already adopted Azure Quantum Elements to transform their research and development, and today, others can join them. Azure Quantum Elements will be available in private preview in a few weeks, and you can sign up today to learn more.

2. Copilot in Azure Quantum

Copilot in Azure Quantum helps scientists use natural language to reason through complex chemistry and materials science problems.

With Copilot in Azure Quantum, a scientist can accomplish complex tasks on top of a fabric of cloud supercomputing, advanced AI and quantum all integrated with the tools they use today. It can generate the underlying calculations and simulations, query and visualize data and help get guided answers to complicated concepts. Just as Copilot in other Microsoft products is transforming software development, productivity and search, our ambition is for Copilot in Azure Quantum to transform and accelerate scientific discovery — whether it’s creating safer and more sustainable products, accelerating drug discovery or solving the most pressing challenges on the planet.

Copilot also helps people learn about quantum computing and write code for today’s quantum computers. It provides a fully integrated, browser-based experience available to try for free with a built-in code editor, quantum simulator and seamless code compilation. We designed it to make the complex more manageable and help anyone explore quantum, chemistry and materials science while bringing these transformational fields closer together. Check it out today.

3. Microsoft’s roadmap to a quantum supercomputer

The ultimate unlock will come when organizations are able to accurately design new chemicals and materials with a quantum supercomputer. Our industry will follow a similar path as classical supercomputers did in the 20th century. From vacuum tubes, to transistors, to integrated circuits, advances in underlying technology will enable scale and impact.

As we make progress as an industry, quantum hardware will fall into one of the three categories of Quantum Computing Implementation Levels:

Level 1 – Foundational: Quantum systems that run on noisy physical qubits, which includes all of today’s Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.
Level 2 – Resilient: Quantum systems that operate on reliable logical qubits.
Level 3 – Scale: Quantum supercomputers that can solve impactful problems that even the most powerful supercomputers cannot.

 

To reach Scale, a fundamental physics breakthrough is required. Microsoft has achieved this breakthrough and today presented the peer reviewed data in a journal by the American Physical Society.

This means that Microsoft has achieved the first milestone towards a quantum supercomputer. We can now create and control Majorana quasiparticles. With this achievement, we’re well on our way to engineering a new hardware-protected qubit. With it, we can then engineer reliable logical qubits to reach the Resilient Level and then progress to reach Scale.

 

A quantum supercomputer will be able to solve problems that are intractable on a classical computer and scale to solve the most complex problems facing our world. To do this, it must be both performant and reliable. Customers need to understand how capable a quantum system is of solving real problems, from the machine to the network overhead. That’s why measuring a supercomputer can’t be about counting physical or logical qubits.

To understand a supercomputer’s performance, our industry needs a new measurement. For that, we’re offering the metric of reliable Quantum Operations Per Second (rQOPS), which measures how many reliable operations can be executed in one second. It considers the full system performance, as opposed to just qubit performance, so there is an assurance that an algorithm will run correctly.

Our industry is yet to transition from the NISQ era and therefore, today’s quantum computers are all at Level 1 with a rQOPS of zero. The first quantum supercomputer will need at least 1 million rQOPS and will scale to more than 1 billion to solve impactful chemistry and materials science problems.

Accelerating scientific discovery together

With the advent of any innovative technology, there are risks that need to be planned for and mitigated. Microsoft’s AI principles guide us and these fundamental tenets apply to quantum as well. As we develop new services like Azure Quantum Elements and engineer our first quantum supercomputer, we will apply additional measures of rigor incorporating feedback throughout the process.

We are also preparing now for a quantum-safe future. Microsoft has a comprehensive plan to ensure all our services remain secure and is partnering with our customers and the industry to support this important transition.

The opportunity in front of us is immense. Scientists and businesses will revolutionize the building blocks of everyday products to usher in a new era of innovation and economic growth. Together, we can compress the next 250 years of chemistry and materials science into the next 25.

Space Education Day 2023: Inspiring the next generation of innovators,"Space engages people of all ages by sparking curiosity of the unknown. With NASA’s progress toward its first lunar missions in more than 50 years, a new generation of Americans can witness the awe-inspiring power and joy of a moon landing. It can also inspire people of all ages and backgrounds to pursue space-related science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) careers, from astronauts to engineers and physicists to technicians.

In recent years, we have witnessed significant diversity milestones in space exploration. Among these are the first all-female spacewalk and NASA’s diverse international crew of astronauts for the Artemis II lunar mission, where the first woman and first person of color will step foot on the moon. Although these achievements signal an important shift in the industry, women still represent only 20% of the space workforce. Black and Hispanic professionals remain underrepresented in STEM professions. Of the entire STEM workforce, a total of 24% are members of an underrepresented minority group. These statistics highlight the urgent need to continue expanding access to STEM education and the study of space — a core tenet of the Microsoft-NASA partnership that aims to address these inequities head on.

Microsoft and NASA’s innovative partnership

Critical to Microsoft and NASA’s more than two-decades of partnership is investing in the next generation by promoting STEM education across all communities. As part of this effort Microsoft is honored to collaborate with NASA to host our first Space Education Day — a showcase of students and educators across Washington, D.C. — on Tuesday, June 20 at Microsoft’s office in Arlington, Virginia.

Space Education Day provides local students an opportunity to connect with Microsoft and NASA members during a day of innovative learning and technology demonstrations. We are thrilled to welcome students from the greater Washington, D.C region, home to a diverse pre-kindergarten through 12th grade population. There will be live demonstrations with the help of students who learned to program in the Minecraft Education portal, an immersive learning platform inspired by NASA’s Artemis Missions. Microsoft’s Minecraft Education recently partnered with NASA and the Challenge Center to equip students with future-ready skills for the next era of space exploration, and now students will have the opportunity to exercise these skills in real-time.

“Our next generation of innovators need opportunities and resources that engage the Artemis Generation to reach for the moon and beyond,” said Mike Kincaid, associate administrator for NASA’s Office of STEM Engagement. “Investing in our students from all backgrounds today will build a diverse workforce that will ultimately achieve future breakthroughs in space.”

Featured sessions at Space Education Day include:

Microsoft Space Camps – Minecraft Artemis: Students will explore the lunar surface and learn about NASA’s Artemis program in a fun and immersive Minecraft environment.
Azure Space Hackathon – College students will showcase their experience and technology using NASA satellite imagery and Microsoft’s AI capabilities and the Planetary Computer to find offshore windfarms around the world.
NASA MSI Space Accelerators – Partners will discuss the goals and objectives of the NASA Space Accelerator program to connect minority-serving institutions to mentorship and funding opportunities from NASA and Microsoft.

Space Education Day continues Microsoft and NASA’s efforts to develop high-impact initiatives and educational resources that promote STEM education for all. A student hackathon hosted last May by Azure Space and NASA called Coding for the Cosmos convened students from two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in Washington, D.C. to establish new technologies, including deploying code to the International Space Station.

Technology and the power of space can be used as a powerful tool to inspire, prepare and engage people of all ages and backgrounds, and Microsoft will continue to seek new opportunities to keep everyone reaching for the stars.

“Our collaboration with NASA allows us to provide new and exciting opportunities for students of all backgrounds to explore the space industry and related technologies,” said Steve Kitay, Senior Director of Azure Space. “One of the key purposes of Azure Space is to bring space, cloud computing, and other new technologies to the next generation – particularly those that might not otherwise have the opportunity.”

By continuing to integrate Microsoft technologies with NASA’s missions, data and expertise, it is our goal to broaden the ecosystem of STEM and empower our future workforce to explore the endless boundaries of space.

Announcing Microsoft’s AI Customer Commitments,"
		AI is creating unparalleled opportunities for businesses of every size and across every industry. We are seeing our customers embrace AI services to drive innovation, increase productivity and solve critical problems for humanity, such as the development of breakthrough medical cures and new ways to meet the challenges of climate change.
At the same time, there are legitimate concerns about the power of the technology and the potential for it to be used to cause harm rather than benefits. It’s not surprising, in this context, that governments around the world are looking at how existing laws and regulations can be applied to AI and are considering what new legal frameworks may be needed. Ensuring the right guardrails for the responsible use of AI will not be limited to technology companies and governments: every organization that creates or uses AI systems will need to develop and implement its own governance systems. That’s why today we are announcing three AI Customer Commitments to assist our customers on their responsible AI journey.

First, we will share what we are learning about developing and deploying AI responsibly and assist you in learning how to do the same. Microsoft has been on a responsible AI journey since 2017, harnessing the skills of nearly 350 engineers, lawyers and policy experts dedicated to implementing a robust governance process that guides the design, development and deployment of AI in safe, secure and transparent ways. More specifically we are:

Sharing expertise: We are committed to sharing this knowledge and expertise with you by publishing the key documents we developed during this process so that you can learn from our experiences. These include our Responsible AI Standard, AI Impact Assessment Template, AI Impact Assessment Guide, Transparency Notes, and detailed primers on the implementation of our responsible AI by design approach.
Providing training curriculum: We will also share the work we are doing to build a practice and culture of responsible AI at Microsoft, including key parts of the curriculum that we use to train Microsoft employees.
Creating dedicated resources: We will invest in dedicated resources and expertise in regions around the world to respond to your questions about deploying and using AI responsibly.

Second, we are creating an AI Assurance Program to help you ensure that the AI applications you deploy on our platforms meet the legal and regulatory requirements for responsible AI. This program will include the following elements:

Regulator engagement support: We have extensive experience helping customers in the public sector and highly regulated industries manage the spectrum of regulatory issues that arise when dealing with the use of information technology. For example, in the global financial services industry, we worked closely for a number of years with both customers and regulators to ensure that this industry could pursue digital transformation on the cloud while complying with its regulatory obligations. One learning from this experience has been the industry’s requirement that financial institutions verify customer identities, establish risk profiles and monitor transactions to help detect suspicious activity, the “know your customer” requirements. We believe that this approach can apply to AI in what we are calling “KY3C,” an approach that creates certain obligations to know one’s cloud, one’s customers and one’s content. We want to work with you to apply KY3C as part of our AI Assurance Program.



Risk framework implementation: We will attest to how we are implementing the AI Risk Management Framework recently published by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and will share our experience engaging with NIST’s important ongoing work in this area.
Customer councils: We will bring customers together in customer councils to hear their views on how we can deliver the most relevant and compliant AI technology and tools.
Regulatory advocacy: Finally, we’ll play an active role in engaging with governments to promote effective and interoperable AI regulation. The recently launched Microsoft blueprint for AI governance presents our proposals to governments and other stakeholders for appropriate regulatory frameworks for AI. We have made available a presentation of this blueprint by Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith and a white paper discussing it in detail.

Third, we will support you as you implement your own AI systems responsibly, and we will develop responsible AI programs for our partner ecosystem.

Dedicated resources: We will create a dedicated team of AI legal and regulatory experts in regions around the world as a resource for you to support your implementation of responsible AI governance systems in your businesses.
Partner support: Many of our partners have already created comprehensive practices to help customers evaluate, test, adopt and commercialize AI solutions, including creating their own responsible AI systems. We are launching a program with selected partners to leverage this expertise to assist our mutual customers in deploying their own responsible AI systems. Today we can announce that PwC and EY are our launch partners for this exciting program.

Ultimately, we know that these commitments are only the start, and we will have to build on them as both the technology and regulatory conditions evolve. But we are also excited by this opportunity to partner more closely with our customers as we continue on the responsible AI journey together.

Building a quantum-safe future,"As innovation has progressed through radio, the internet, Wi-Fi, smartphones, and the Internet of Things, we have consistently faced security concerns with each technological milestone. Every new and disruptive technology comes with both opportunities and challenges.

With AI, we are heeding this lesson from the past and proactively addressing the security challenges that will inevitably arise.

Yet while the AI revolution feels like the biggest innovation in a generation, scaled quantum computing is set to disrupt many aspects of technology again — and we must prepare for it now.

Quantum computing at scale has the potential to help solve many of the world’s most complex and pressing problems. Whether it’s addressing food sustainability, developing better batteries, or mitigating climate change via carbon capture, scientists will have unprecedented computing power at their disposal. This transformational computing power capable of driving so much societal good could also be used by bad actors looking to cause disruption and harm. By advancing our security capabilities to meet this moment, people and organizations can reap the profound benefits of quantum computing without succumbing to these threats.

Microsoft embarked on the road to quantum more than 20 years ago and is in a unique position to contribute to a quantum-safe future. The investments we have made in this emerging field help us to understand new risks it may introduce and how to mitigate them early and effectively.

How quantum computing could upend encryption


Today, most security systems in existing IT environments rely on public-key cryptography, which is used almost everywhere from messaging to transactions to securing data at rest. These cryptographic systems are based on mathematical problems that are difficult and time- consuming for classical computers but will be much easier and quicker for quantum computers to solve.

The strength of current cryptographic systems lies in the complexity of certain mathematical problems, one of which involves finding the factor of extraordinarily large numbers — a task that would take traditional computers millions of years to solve. This is the core principle behind the RSA algorithm that’s been in use since the 1970s. Systems using RSA today range from hardware devices such as smart cards and routers, to software applications such as web browsers and email clients. RSA is also used throughout the supply chain of these systems, from the manufacturing of components to the distribution of software updates.

Yet, the emergence of quantum computers has the potential to dramatically upset this balance. Using Shor’s algorithm, a quantum computer may be able to unravel these large-number factors in mere minutes, rendering RSA and similar asymmetric algorithms vulnerable. As we progress, algorithm agility, resiliency and flexibility will be needed to easily switch or combine cryptographic approaches — a process that will require significant financial investment, changes in existing infrastructure, and timely planning, execution and coordination across supply chains and ecosystems.

Scaled quantum machines are on the way

A quantum machine capable of running Shor’s algorithm will likely need more than a million stable qubits — thousands of times more than today’s quantum computers. These powerful scaled machines are on the way and responsible companies will ensure these quantum systems are not used by bad actors.

At Microsoft, our quantum machine will be delivered as a cloud service through Azure. Just as we do with other technologies, Microsoft will deploy technical and operational controls to ensure our quantum machine will not be used maliciously.

But not every quantum machine in the future will be protected in this way. Immediate risks, such as “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” scenarios and the potential obsolescence of un-updatable IoT devices, already demand our attention. For these reasons, we must start preparing and acting now, because the transition to become quantum safe for most organizations will take time. That’s why we recommend organizations get ready today, which we explain in more detail below. The risk posed by quantum computers is not imminent nor insurmountable, but the transition to become quantum-safe for most organizations will be a significant undertaking.

Just over two decades ago, the Y2K challenge wasn’t insurmountable or unsolvable, but it took a huge, industry-wide effort to get ready for the change. Today cryptographic systems are spread all over the globe, and the distributed and interconnected services, products and platforms handling those systems means there is an immense threat surface that needs to be prepared and updated to become quantum resistant.

The global community is rallying around quantum-safe readiness

The security industry has been preparing for quantum computers and the associated risks to classical cryptography. Governments and the private sector are investing in research, development, and standardization of quantum-safe approaches such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms and potential quantum technologies to strengthen security. As a first step toward PQC adoption, the U.S. National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) has been engaged in a years-long effort to solicit, evaluate and standardize quantum-resistant algorithms for broader adoption.

In Europe, the European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) is assessing quantum-safe cryptographic protocols and standards and their practical implementation. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is evaluating PQC algorithms and has established a technical committee to build collaboration on international standards for PQC.

Microsoft has been investing in PQC research, development, experimentation and collaborations since 2014, playing a role in the emergence of PQC and public standards globally. We are participating in SC27/WG2 international standards efforts and have been in close collaboration with NIST, supporting and contributing to their National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence project on Migration to Post-Quantum Cryptography, whose goal is to prepare organizations for the PQC transition.

Microsoft is a core member and supporter of the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project, and we are leading the PQC working group for SAFECode, a global industry forum for business leaders and technical experts to advance industry standards and help organizations prepare for the PQC transition. We have also been focused on quantum technologies and their impact on security with dedicated research and development of tools.

As the ecosystem progresses, we continue to encourage industry and government to invest in the global adoption of harmonized cryptographic standards and additional quantum-safe measures to facilitate secure global trade in the future.

Quantum-safe across Microsoft’s ecosystem

Given Microsoft’s unique position and wide perspective developing both hardware and software — along with our experience from past efforts transitioning to new cryptographic algorithms — we know that the journey to achieve quantum safety will be a significant undertaking.

This will be an iterative and collaborative process, and we are committed to being a trusted partner across industry and government. Transparency and clarity will be key to success, and as we continue to make progress, we will share learnings and recommendations with the broader community.

One of the best ways for an organization to accelerate their quantum-safe readiness is to move to the hyperscale cloud, but not all our customers and partners are using the cloud. With this in mind, we are taking a comprehensive approach across our platforms and systems.

Today we are taking the necessary steps across our own portfolio and ecosystem to ensure our products and services remain secure against potential risks the technology continues to develop.

We have formed a group of experts from across the company to concentrate on this matter with constant input from regulators, industry partners, vendors and legal experts and research teams. We have also started efforts to create, test, and implement practical cryptographic solutions that can resist potential threats posed by quantum computers. We are deepening our knowledge of quantum-safe algorithms and mitigation options for various use cases, considering hybrid encryption schemes to accommodate adaptive updates in cryptography algorithms, creating a cryptographic inventory to identify vulnerable cryptography in our platforms and services, and developing a multi-phase roadmap to address gaps and prioritize crucial areas.

From the cloud to on-premises environments, we are assessing every piece of technology that connects to Microsoft. Our goal is to make this journey as simple and manageable as possible both for us and for our customers and partners.

The time to prepare is now — and Microsoft is here to help

It will take time to implement such sweeping changes, but the sooner you start, the safer you’ll be. It is essential to raise awareness and deepen all of our understanding of the risks — and to start now.

If you’re wondering where to begin, creating an inventory of critical data and cryptography technologies can reveal areas where cryptography is implemented incorrectly or in a way that’s unsuitable for its intended purposes. It is crucial to identify internal standards and processes and assess all options to update those cryptography protocols and libraries to mitigate potential risks.

Based on those inventories and assessments, we recommend prioritizing your systems and services based on criteria such as criticality, dependencies and cost. From there, develop a transition roadmap.

We are already helping several customers and partners, notably those in risk-sensitive industries, in their quest to be quantum-safe by providing resources and transition strategies. Yet, the urgency for all organizations to embark on this journey cannot be overstated. We encourage customers and partners to act now, and we’re here to support.

As quantum technology continues to advance and change the world, our commitment to the security of our products and customers has never been stronger. We are dedicated to minimizing the efforts required by our customers and partners to become quantum-safe, using our world-leading research and engineering teams to keep our products and services secure.

Reflections on AI and the future of human flourishing,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have sparked both wonder and anxiety as we contemplate its transformative potential. AI holds enormous promise to enrich our lives, but this anticipation comes intertwined with apprehensions about the challenges and risks that may emerge. To nurture a future where AI is leveraged to the benefit of people and society, it is crucial to bring together a wide array of voices and perspectives.

With this goal in mind, I am honored to present the “AI Anthology,” a compilation of 20 inspiring essays authored by distinguished scholars and professionals from various disciplines. The anthology explores the diverse ways in which AI can be channeled to benefit humanity while shedding light on potential challenges. By bringing together these different viewpoints, our aim is to stimulate thought-provoking conversations and encourage collaborative efforts that will guide AI toward a future that harnesses its potential for human flourishing.

I first encountered GPT-4, a remarkable large-scale language model, in the fall of 2022 while serving as the chair of Microsoft’s Aether Committee. The Aether leadership and engineering teams were granted early access to OpenAI’s latest innovation, with a mission to investigate potential challenges and wider societal consequences of its use. Our inquiries were anchored in Microsoft’s AI Principles, which were established by the committee in collaboration with Microsoft’s leadership in 2017. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of GPT-4’s capabilities, focusing on the possible challenges that applications employing this technology could pose in terms of safety, accuracy, privacy and fairness.

GPT-4 left me awestruck. I observed unexpected glimmers of intelligence beyond those seen in prior AI systems. When compared to its predecessor, GPT-3.5 — a model utilized by tens of millions as ChatGPT — I noticed a significant leap in capabilities. Its ability to interpret my intentions and provide sophisticated answers to numerous prompts felt like a “phase transition,” evoking imagery of emergent phenomena that I had encountered in physics. I found that GPT-4 is a polymath, with a remarkable capacity to integrate traditionally disparate concepts and methodologies. It seamlessly weaves together ideas that transcend disciplinary boundaries.

The remarkable capabilities of GPT-4 raised questions about potential disruptions and adverse consequences, as well as opportunities to benefit people and society. While our broader team vigorously explored safety and fairness concerns, I delved into complex challenges within medicine, education and the sciences. It became increasingly evident that the model and its successors — which would likely exhibit further jumps in capabilities — hold tremendous potential to be transformative. This led me to contemplate the wider societal ramifications.

Questions came to mind surrounding artistic creation and attribution, malicious actors, jobs and the economy, and unknown futures that we cannot yet envision. How might people react to no longer being the unparalleled fount of intellectual and artistic thought and creation, as generative AI tools become commonplace? How would these advancements affect our self-identity and individual aspirations? What short- and long-term consequences might be felt in the job market? How might people be credited for their creative contributions that AI systems would be learning from? How might malicious actors exploit these emerging powers to inflict harm? What are important potential unintended consequences of the uses, including those we might not yet foresee?

At the same time, I imagined futures in which people and society could thrive in extraordinary ways by harnessing this technology, just as they have with other revolutionary advances. These transformative influences range from the first tools of cognition — our shared languages, enabling unprecedented cooperation and coordination — to the instruments of science and engineering, the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, and the internet, culminating in today’s recent advances in AI.

Eager to investigate these opportunities in collaboration with others across a wide array of disciplines, we initiated the “AI Anthology” project, with OpenAI’s support. We invited 20 experts to explore GPT-4’s capabilities and contemplate the potential influences of future versions on humanity. Each participant was granted early confidential access to GPT-4, provided case studies in education, scientific exploration and medicine, drawn from my explorations, and asked to focus on two core questions:

How might this technology and its successors contribute to human flourishing?
How might we as society best guide the technology to achieve maximal benefits for humanity?

Building upon the ideas presented in my Tanner Lecture at the University of Michigan in November 2022 (Arc of Intelligence: Humanity and its Tools of Reason and Imagination), these questions highlight the importance of long-term thinking and maintaining an optimistic perspective on AI’s potential to enrich human lives. We could unlock immense potential benefits. But to realize this potential, we must create technical innovations and policies to protect against malicious uses and unintended consequences.

This anthology is a testament to the promise of envisioning and collaboration and to the importance of diverse perspectives in shaping the future of AI. The 20 essays offer a wealth of insights, hopes and concerns, illustrating the complexities and possibilities that arise with the rapid evolution of AI.

As you read these essays, I encourage you to remain open to new ideas, engage in thoughtful conversations, and lend your insights to the ongoing discourse on harnessing AI technology to benefit and empower humanity. The future of AI is not a predetermined path, but a journey we must navigate together with wisdom, foresight and a deep sense of responsibility. I hope that the ideas captured in these essays contribute to our collective understanding of the challenges and opportunities we face. They can help guide our efforts to create a future where AI systems complement human intellect and creativity to promote human flourishing.

Welcome to the “AI Anthology.” May it inspire you, challenge you, and ignite meaningful conversations that lead us toward a future where humanity flourishes by harnessing AI in creative and valuable ways.

We will publish four new essays at the beginning of each week starting today. The complete “AI Anthology” will be available on June 26, 2023.

 

As Microsoft’s Chief Scientific Officer, Eric Horvitz spearheads company-wide initiatives, navigating opportunities and challenges at the confluence of scientific frontiers, technology and society. He is known for his contributions to AI theory and practice, including research on principles and applications of AI amidst the complexities of the open world.

Microsoft Build brings AI tools to the forefront for developers,"You only need two simple letters to accurately convey the major shift in the technology space this year: A and I. Beyond those letters, however, is a complex, evolving and exciting way in which we work, communicate and collaborate. As you will see, artificial intelligence is a common thread as we embark on Microsoft Build, our annual flagship event for developers.

It’s already been a landmark year for the industry, starting in January with the announcement of an extension of our partnership with OpenAI to accelerate AI breakthroughs and to ensure these benefits are broadly shared with the world. And in February, Microsoft announced an all-new, AI-powered Bing search engine and Edge browser to transform the largest software category in the world – search.

Since then, developments have accelerated at a rapid pace, with several key milestones along the way, including:

Greater availability of Azure OpenAI Service with added support for ChatGPT and OpenAI’s groundbreaking GPT-4 model.
Copilots across a wide range of users, including Dynamics 365 Copilot, Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot for Power Platform.
Expansion of a new AI-powered Bing to the Windows 11 taskbar, mobile and Skype; Bing Image Creator to chat; and a full open preview of the platform, no waitlist required.

This is just the beginning of the new era of AI. That’s why Microsoft Build is so important. During this event, we’ll be showcasing how AI is redefining what and how developers build, as well as how AI is changing the future of work.

Before we get into the news, let’s talk about two concepts we are discussing at length during Microsoft Build: copilots and plugins.

A copilot is an application that uses modern AI and large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to assist people with complex tasks. Microsoft first introduced the concept of a copilot nearly two years ago with GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer that assists developers with writing code, and we continue to release copilots across many of the company’s core businesses.

We believe the copilot represents both a new paradigm in AI-powered software and a profound shift in the way that software is built – from imagining new product scenarios, to the user experience, the architecture, the services that it uses and how to think about safety and security.

Plugins are tools first introduced for ChatGPT, and more recently Bing, which augment the capabilities of AI systems, enabling them to interact with application programming interfaces (APIs) from other software and services to retrieve real-time information, incorporate company and other business data, perform new types of computations and safely take action on the user’s behalf. Think of plugins as the connection between copilots and the rest of the digital world.

With that said, let’s focus on the news and announcements we’re unveiling during Microsoft Build.

Growing the AI plugin ecosystem

Microsoft is announcing that we will adopt the same open plugin standard that OpenAI introduced for ChatGPT, enabling interoperability across ChatGPT and the breadth of Microsoft’s copilot offerings.

Developers can now use one platform to build plugins that work across both consumer and business surfaces, including ChatGPT, Bing, Dynamics 365 Copilot and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

And if you want to develop and use your own plugins with your AI application built on Azure OpenAI Service, it will, by default, be interoperable with this same plugin standard. This means developers can build experiences that enable people to interact with their apps using the most natural user interface: the human language.

As part of this shared plugin platform, Bing is adding to its support for plugins. In addition to previously announced plugins for OpenTable and Wolfram Alpha, we will also have Expedia, Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, Redfin and Zillow, among many others in the Bing ecosystem.

In addition to the common plugin platform, Microsoft is announcing that Bing is coming to ChatGPT as the default search experience. ChatGPT will now have a world-class search engine built-in to provide more up-to-date answers with access from the web. Now, answers are grounded by search and web data and include citations so users can learn more, all directly from within chat. The new experience is rolling out to ChatGPT Plus subscribers starting today and will be available to free users soon by simply enabling a plugin.

Developers can now extend Microsoft 365 Copilot with plugins 

We’re also announcing that developers can now integrate their apps and services into Microsoft 365 Copilot with plugins.

Plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot include ChatGPT and Bing plugins, as well as Teams message extensions and Power Platform connectors – enabling developers to leverage their existing investments. And developers will be able to easily build new plugins for Microsoft 365 Copilot with the Microsoft Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio. Developers can also extend Microsoft 365 Copilot by bringing their data into the Microsoft Graph, contextualizing relevant and actionable information with the recently announced Semantic Index for Copilot.

More than 50 plugins from partners will be available for customers as part of the early access program, including Atlassian, Adobe, ServiceNow, Thomson Reuters, Moveworks and Mural, with thousands more available by the general availability of Microsoft 365 Copilot.

New Azure AI tooling to help developers build, operationalize deploy their own next-generation AI apps

It starts with our new Azure AI Studio. We’re making it simple to integrate external data sources into Azure OpenAI Service. In addition, we’re excited to introduce Azure Machine Learning prompt flow to make it easier for developers to construct prompts while taking advantage of popular open-source prompt orchestration solutions like Semantic Kernel.

In Azure OpenAI Service, which brings together advanced models including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure, we’re announcing updates to enable developers to deploy the most cutting-edge AI models using their own data; a Provisioned Throughput SKU that offers dedicated capacity; and plugins that simplify integrating other external data sources into a customer’s use of Azure OpenAI Service. We now have more than 4,500 customers using Azure OpenAI Service.

Building responsibly together

At Microsoft, we’ve been committed to developing AI technology that has a beneficial impact and earns trust, while also sharing our own learnings and building new tools and innovations that help developers and businesses implement responsible AI practices in their own work and organizations. At Build, we’re introducing several new updates, including Azure AI Content Safety, a new Azure AI service to help businesses create safer online environments and communities. As part of Microsoft’s commitment to building responsible AI systems, Azure AI Content Safety will be integrated across Microsoft products, including Azure OpenAI Service and Azure Machine Learning.

We’re also introducing new tools to Azure Machine Learning, including expanding Responsible AI dashboard support for text and image data, in preview, enabling users to evaluate large models built with unstructured data during the model building, training and/or evaluation stage. This helps users identify model errors, fairness issues and model explanations before models are deployed, for more performant and fair computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) models. And prompt flow, in preview soon, provides a streamlined experience for prompting, evaluating and tuning large language models. Users can quickly create prompt workflows that connect to various language models and data sources and assess the quality of their workflows with measurements such as groundedness to choose the best prompt for their use case. Prompt flow also integrates Azure AI Content Safety to help users detect and remove harmful content directly in their flow of work.

In addition, Microsoft announced new media provenance capabilities coming to Microsoft Designer and Bing Image Creator in the coming months that will enable users to verify whether an image or video was generated by AI. The technology uses cryptographic methods to mark and sign AI-generated content with metadata about its origin.

Introducing Microsoft Fabric, a new unified platform for analytics

Today’s world is awash with data, constantly streaming from the devices we use, the applications we build and the interactions we have. And now, as we enter a new era defined by AI, this data is becoming even more important. Powering organization-specific AI experiences requires a constant supply of clean data from a well-managed and highly integrated analytics system. But most organizations’ analytics systems are a labyrinth of specialized and disconnected services.

Microsoft Fabric is a unified platform for analytics that includes data engineering, data integration, data warehousing, data science, real-time analytics, applied observability and business intelligence, all connected to a single data repository called OneLake.

It enables customers of all technical levels to experience capabilities in a single, unified experience. It is infused with Azure OpenAI Service at every layer to help customers unlock the full potential of their data, enabling developers to leverage the power of generative AI to find insights in their data.

With Copilot in Microsoft Fabric in every data experience, customers can use conversational language to create dataflows and data pipelines, generate code and entire functions, build machine learning models or visualize results. Customers can even create their own conversational language experiences that combine Azure OpenAI Service models and their data and publish them as plugins.

Accelerating an AI-powered future through partners

Our customers benefit from our partner collaborations, such as with NVIDIA, that enable organizations to design, develop, deploy and manage applications with the scale and security of Azure. NVIDIA will accelerate enterprise-ready generative AI with NVIDIA AI Enterprise Integration with Azure Machine Learning. Omniverse Cloud, only available on Azure, enables organizations to aggregate data into massive, high-performance models, connect their domain-specific software tools and enable multi-user live collaboration across factory locations. NVIDIA GPUs leveraging ONNX Runtime & Olive toolchain will support the implementation of accelerating AI models without needing a deeper knowledge of the hardware.

New capabilities for Microsoft Dev Box

Microsoft Dev Box, an Azure service that gives developers access to ready-to-code, project-specific dev boxes that are preconfigured and centrally managed, is introducing several new capabilities to enhance the developer experience and boost productivity. While in preview, we’ve seen many customers experimenting with Dev Box, and we’ve migrated more than 9,000 developers internally to the service for day-to-day software development.

Now, we’ve added additional features and capabilities, including customization using configuration-as-code and new starter developer images in Azure Marketplace that provide dev teams with ready-to-use images that can be customized further for specific dev team needs. Additionally, developers can now manage custom environments from a specialized developer portal, Azure Deployment Environments. Dev Box general availability will begin in July.

Unveiling a new home for developers on Windows 11 with Dev Home 

Dev Home will launch at Microsoft Build in preview as a new Windows experience developers can get from the Microsoft Store.

Dev Home makes it easy to connect to GitHub and configure cloud development environments like Microsoft Dev Box and GitHub Codespaces. Dev Home is open source and fully extensible, enabling developers to enhance their experience with a customizable dashboard and the tools they need to be successful.

Introducing Windows Copilot for Windows 11

Last fall at our Windows and Surface launch, Chief Product Officer Panos Panay talked about the power of AI to unlock new interaction models on the PC with Windows Studio Effects and DALL-E 2 in Microsoft Designer, and at CES he talked about how AI is going to reinvent the way people get things done on Windows.

This brings us to Windows Copilot.

Windows will be the first PC platform to centralize AI assistance with the introduction of Windows Copilot. Together, with Bing Chat and first- and third-party plugins, users can focus on bringing their ideas to life, completing complex projects and collaborating instead of spending energy finding, launching and working across multiple applications.

This builds on the integration we released into Windows 11 back in February that brought the new AI-powered Bing to the taskbar.

A preview of Windows Copilot will start to become available for Windows 11 in June.

As you can see, it’s going to be a busy time at Microsoft Build. To give you a sense of what developers are going to experience at the event, we’re expecting approximately 200,000 registered attendees, with 350 sessions and more than 125 hours of content over two days. In total, we’ll announce more than 50 new products and features.

For more information, make sure to watch keynotes on demand from Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, Kevin Scott and Scott Guthrie on Day 1.

Meeting governments where they are: Delivering innovation while maintaining digital sovereignty,"As governments today look at technology innovation, there is a need to address the rapidly evolving demands of their citizens while protecting the most sensitive data and delivering on promises of trust and security. Modernization of government services without compromising security, digitization of manual processes and improved user experiences for both citizens and government employees are all benefits of digital transformation, and the right technology platforms can create even better opportunities for social and economic growth.

The cloud can offer agility and flexibility, advanced cybersecurity features, and access to the latest innovations, including AI, to accelerate digital transformation and the delivery of essential public services. Many governments want to take advantage of the benefits of the public cloud while also managing their data in accordance with their local policies and regulatory requirements. They need solutions that ensure digital sovereignty, giving them control over their data in the cloud. In July of last year, we announced Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, a new solution that will enable governments to build and digitally transform workloads in the Microsoft cloud while helping to meet many of their specific compliance, security and policy requirements. Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty creates software boundaries in the cloud to establish the extra protection that governments require, leveraging hardware-based confidentiality and encryption controls.

Since then, we have engaged with numerous government leaders, policymakers and public sector organizations in Europe and the rest of the world about why the cloud is the best solution for sovereignty needs. We have delivered two Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty private preview releases that validated the power and scale of the cloud with adherence to government requirements and empowered government customers with the digital transformation they are striving for. It also helped identify three key obstacles impeding governments from meeting their digital transformation and innovation goals: Complying with legislative and regulatory requirements; protecting and securing sensitive data; and innovating without compromise.

Comply with legislative and regulatory requirements

Before taking advantage of the many benefits of the cloud, government policymakers want to have confidence in the security and privacy of their data and the ability to keep innovating while protecting that data. A key element of this is meeting their legislative or regulatory obligations. This is where Microsoft’s transparency commitments come in.

Many governments require transparency regarding how Microsoft responds to third-party data requests.  At the core of our business, we adhere to the following policies across our services and commit this to our customers:

Microsoft does not provide direct and unfettered access to our customers’ data. We do not share encryption keys or the ability to break our encryption with anyone, including any government.
Governments must follow the applicable legal process to request customer data. They must serve us with a warrant for content or a court order or subpoena for subscriber information or other non-content data.
All requests must target specific accounts and identifiers. Microsoft’s legal compliance team reviews all submissions to ensure they are valid and rejects those that are not. We use a variety of legal means to challenge data requests, provide data only when a request is valid and provide only the data specified in a legal order.

As all major cloud service providers operate globally, governments often wonder how legislation such as the U.S. CLOUD Act impacts cloud providers. This law does not change any of the legal and privacy protections. Microsoft adheres to the same principles and customer commitments for government demands for user data.

Microsoft’s semi-annual law enforcement request report, part of our transparency measures, reveals that the vast majority of our customers are never impacted by government requests for data. For example, in the first half of 2022, Microsoft received 41 legal demands from law enforcement in the United States for commercial, educational, and public sector customers who purchased more than 50 seats. Of those demands, there were no disclosures of content data related to a non-U.S. customer whose data was stored outside of the United States.

With Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, we provide additional sovereign guardrails that help ensure data is protected in transit and in storage by customer-owned keys not accessible to Microsoft and protected in use when using Azure confidential computing, delivering unmatched software and hardware protections such that only customers with the proper keys can access the data when unencrypted.

Ability to protect and secure sensitive data

With the rapid increases in volume, severity, and sophistication of cyberattacks, it is increasingly clear that the cloud is the best way to protect data.  The cloud provides government customers with world-class protection and unmatched resources and scale to detect, respond and deter attacks early on.

Microsoft Cloud and Azure are trusted by millions of customers with their most sensitive and mission-critical workloads. We offer a wide variety of tools to monitor and respond to security threats, as well as specialized services to help governments keep their data safe. With more than 8,500 Microsoft security experts across 77 countries, we have helped provide a critical perspective on the security landscape and are continuously fine-tuning our security approaches as we learn from each cyberattack. With the addition of the Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, government customers can establish their own software boundary in the cloud while taking full advantage of Azure’s best-in-class security, resilience and scale capabilities.  Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty allows customers to leverage key Azure capabilities including:

Microsoft’s Azure Key Vault Managed Hardware Security Module allows customers to maintain complete control of the cryptographic key, while still benefiting from the redundancy, resilience, cybersecurity and managed experience of the cloud.
Azure confidential computing is a unique service that protects data in use and allows the data to be processed only after the cloud environment is verified to be a trusted execution environment. In this way, confidential computing helps protect data from being accessed by cloud operators, malicious admins, and even privileged software such as the hypervisor. It helps keep data protected throughout its lifecycle — in addition to existing solutions of protecting data at rest and in transit, data is now protected while in use. In Azure, the root of trust is with independent hardware, so even Microsoft operators cannot access the memory encryption keys. This independent hardware root trust is what helps government customers to independently cryptographically verify the identity and “known good state” of the cloud operating environment they are relying on.

With Microsoft, governments can take advantage of our view of the evolving threat landscape. With industry-leading AI, we synthesize 65 trillion security signals a day across all types of devices, apps, platforms and endpoints, which is an eight times increase from the 8 trillion daily signals captured just two years ago. And we apply the learnings from that signal intelligence, as well as from our world-class threat intelligence, into all the products and services we offer. Furthermore, we now have more than 15,000 partners working with us across our security ecosystem, helping to bring better solutions and more choices to the market. Our global threat intelligence perspective enables early detection and response to emerging threats across multi-cloud, hybrid, on-premises and heterogeneous platforms.

Innovation without compromise

Embracing digital innovation while ensuring digital sovereignty is a challenge for governments. Investing in a private, isolated on-premises datacenter might, at face value, seem to be the only way to achieve the level of control and security a government requires. But building on a private cloud requires maintaining on-premises datacenters, which are no longer viable due to their inability to scale and deliver the security and functionality that the cloud provides. Finally, we also hear from our customers that they are operating under increasingly restrained resources and shrinking budgets. The cloud offers governments the ability to operate on a lean budget, compared to on-premises. Migrating to the cloud can enable governments to take advantage of the agile benefits of the cloud and focus their spending on the latest innovations in the delivery of services.

As technologies advance, they are taken to the cloud first. Governments that adopt the cloud benefit from the latest innovations changing how governments operate, including AI, blockchain, digital identity and online services, while those that maintain or expand their private cloud investments may not benefit from the same growth and innovation.

Innovating while meeting digital sovereignty requirements is complex and can differ greatly between customers, industries and geographies. We believe a cloud solution designed to address sovereignty needs to have advanced capabilities built with the needs of government customers in mind and must be customizable and flexible to adhere to evolving local policies and regulatory requirements around the handling of data.

Now for the first time, governments are not forced to choose between digital innovation and data control; they can have both. With Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty, we are investing further in guardrails such as Sovereign Landing Zones, local policy packs and increased transparency throughout Azure, creating a virtual sovereign cloud environment for customer workloads. This helps enable customers to take advantage of best practices and implement secure, consistent and compliant environments and adhere to evolving local regulations while taking full advantage of the cloud.

Ensuring compliance and driving digital transformation

The public sector will always need to protect and secure sensitive data, comply with legislative and regulatory requirements and innovate without compromise. At Microsoft, we strive to meet these needs by providing customers with transparency and unsurpassed data controls, investing in cybersecurity and collaborating with governments worldwide to meet their policy and regulatory needs.

It is no longer necessary for governments to choose between innovation and digital sovereignty. Governments can now harness the full power of the cloud, including broad platform capabilities, while having greater control over their data and increased transparency to the operational and governance processes of the cloud — allowing governments to ensure compliance while driving their digital transformation.

Introducing the Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program and 2023 Microsoft Work Trend Index,"In March, we introduced the world to Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work. We’re excited to share the next step in our journey as we bring Copilot to more customers and introduce new capabilities. We’re also releasing new data and insights from our 2023 Work Trend Index on how work is changing in the era of AI.

Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program
Since March, we’ve been testing Copilot with 20 enterprise customers, learning alongside companies like Chevron, Goodyear, General Motors and Dow. Their overwhelming feedback is that Copilot has the potential to revolutionize work. They point to how it is a game changer for meetings and is beginning to transform the way they create. And, they’ve identified areas where we can do more to help people adapt to this new way of working, like the need for more conversational, multi-turn interactions. As we bring Copilot to more customers, we’ll continue to rely on this kind of feedback to refine Copilot and help guide users as they adapt to this new way of working.

“The potential of Microsoft 365 Copilot is undeniable, and it’s energizing to explore the possibilities as we couple the ingenuity of our people with the functionality of the tool. Early access has given us visibility into how it can further streamline processes, speed insights, spark ideas, enhance productivity and evolve the way we work. We’re proud to team with Microsoft as we continue to achieve new levels of innovation and advance the future of energy.” – Guy Moore, Workforce Enablement Lead, Chevron

Today, we’re excited to announce the Microsoft 365 Copilot Early Access Program, an invitation-only, paid preview that will roll out to an initial wave of 600 customers worldwide.

And, to help every customer get AI-ready, we’ll also start rolling out Semantic Index for Copilot – a new capability in Microsoft 365 E3 and E5. Semantic Index for Copilot is a sophisticated map of your user and company data. For example, when you ask it about the “March Sales Report,” it doesn’t simply look for documents with those words in the file name or body. Instead, it understands that “sales reports are produced by Kelly on the finance team and created in Excel.” And it uses that conceptual understanding to determine your intent and help you find what you need. The Semantic Index for Copilot is critical to getting relevant, actionable responses to prompts in Microsoft 365 Copilot. And, it enhances enterprise search results for E3 and E5 customers – whether they are using Copilot or not.

2023 Work Trend Index
The platform shift to AI is well underway. Just as customers turned to Microsoft to help them make the shift to remote and flexible work, they’re now turning to us to help them understand how this new era of AI will change work yet again.

Our 2023 Annual Work Trend Index surveyed 31,000 people in 31 countries and analyzed trillions of aggregated productivity signals in Microsoft 365, along with labor market trends on LinkedIn to understand what the new era of AI means for work. The data paints a clear picture: The pace and volume of work has increased exponentially, and employees are struggling under the weight of work – putting innovation at risk. Leaders and employees alike are eager for AI to lift the burden.

“This new generation of AI will remove the drudgery of work and unleash creativity,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “There’s an enormous opportunity for AI-powered tools to help alleviate digital debt, build AI aptitude, and empower employees.”

The report unearthed three key insights business leaders need to know now, as they look to responsibly adopt AI:

Digital debt costing us innovation
We’re all carrying digital debt: The volume of data, emails and chats has outpaced our ability to process it all. Every minute spent managing this digital debt is a minute not spent on creative work. In a world where creativity is the new productivity, digital debt is more than an inconvenience – it’s impacting business.

When 62% of employees report spending too much time searching for information, communicating and coordinating, they have less time for deep thinking, creating and social collaboration. Nearly two in three people say they don’t have enough time and energy to do their job. And those same employees are 3.5 times more likely to struggle with innovation and strategic thinking.

There’s a new AI-employee alliance
One of the predominant narratives around AI is the notion employees are fearful it may ultimately put them out of a job. While 49% of our respondents had some concerns about job security, a staggering 70% would still choose to delegate as much work as possible to AI to lessen their workloads. Simply put: Employees know what’s in it for them, the promise of relief outweighs the threat. They envision using AI not just for administrative tasks, but also for analytical and creative work.

This is one place where employees and leaders agree. Our data shows managers are two times more likely to say they’re looking to empower people with AI, rather than replace them. In fact, reducing headcount was last on their list. Their top hopes for AI? Increasing productivity, automating tasks, increasing employee well-being and enabling employees to focus on impactful work.

Every employee needs AI aptitude
AI will introduce an entirely new interaction model between humans and computers, and soon we won’t be able to imagine work without it. A platform shift this big will require new skilling – from prompt engineering to reimagining workflows with AI. Eighty-two percent of leaders anticipate employees will need new skills in the AI era, and we’re already seeing a 79% year-over-year increase in the number of LinkedIn job postings in the U.S. that reference “GPT” or “GAI” (generative artificial intelligence).

Employees are ready for this new aptitude — learning new skills is the No. 1 thing they’d do with more time and energy. Leaders feel the same: Learning new skills is also the No. 1 thing they wish their employees would do with more time and energy.

Introducing new Microsoft 365 Copilot capabilities
When we introduced Copilot in March, we unveiled capabilities across the Microsoft 365 suite of apps that millions use every day to get work done. We’re not stopping there – we’re continuing to add new Copilot capabilities to bring AI to every part of the suite, enabling employees and organizations to unleash creativity, unlock productivity and uplevel skills.

Copilot in Whiteboard will make Microsoft Teams meetings and brainstorms more creative and effective. Using natural language, you can ask Copilot to generate ideas, organize ideas into themes, create designs that bring ideas to life and summarize whiteboard content.
By integrating DALL-E, OpenAI’s image generator, into PowerPoint, users will be able to ask Copilot to create custom images to support their content.
Copilot in Outlook will offer coaching tips and suggestions on clarity, sentiment and tone to help users write more effective emails and communicate more confidently.
Copilot in OneNote will use prompts to draft plans, generate ideas, create lists and organize information to help customers find what they need easily.
Copilot in Loop helps your team stay in sync by quickly summarizing all the content on your Loop page to keep everyone aligned and able to collaborate effectively.
Copilot in Viva Learning will use a natural language chat interface to help users create a personalized learning journey including designing upskilling paths, discovering relevant learning resources and scheduling time for assigned trainings.

As we bring Microsoft 365 Copilot to customers, we are guided by our AI principles and Responsible AI Standard and decades of research on AI, grounding and privacy-preserving machine learning. A multidisciplinary team of researchers, engineers and policy experts reviews our AI systems for potential harms and mitigations — refining training data, filtering to limit harmful content, query- and result-blocking sensitive topics, and applying Microsoft technologies like InterpretML and Fairlearn to help detect and correct data bias. We make it clear how the system makes decisions by noting limitations, linking to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check and adjust content based on subject-matter expertise.

The platform shift to AI is underway, ushering in a new wave of productivity growth. And for both overwhelmed employees and leaders looking to bolster productivity, that promise can’t come soon enough. AI represents a whole new way of working – one that will require new skills and habits. Organizations that embrace this new way of working from AI on “autopilot” to AI as copilot will create a brighter, more fulfilling future of work for everyone.

Cloud-based chip design for national security achieves key milestone,"Continued U.S. leadership in emerging technology requires a sustainable supply of advanced chips to power innovation from artificial intelligence to quantum computing. The CHIPS and Science Act, passed last year, aims to boost domestic research and manufacturing capacity for critical microelectronics. To support this ambitious effort, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) launched the Rapid Assured Microelectronics Prototypes (RAMP) using Advanced Commercial Capabilities program, an effort to accelerate the secure, sustainable development of microelectronics for defense technologies.

As part of this effort, three new state-of-the-art chips were developed using the RAMP secure design capability developed by Microsoft within the Azure Government cloud environment to ensure compliance with DoD supply chain requirements. This achievement is a key milestone that marks the first time such chips were designed in the cloud and transmitted via the cloud to chip foundries for manufacture. This process rapidly accelerates the time to market for critical microelectronic components and represents a significant milestone in secure cloud-based microelectronic design and manufacturing. It is also extendable to the commercial design environment in Azure, accelerating the goals of the CHIPS Act to enable a sustainable domestic supply chain for semiconductors.

DoD originally awarded RAMP in September 2020 through the Strategic & Spectrum Missions Advanced Resilient Trusted Systems, managed by National Security Technology Accelerator, with the follow-on prototype RAMP PHASE II awarded in August 2021.

These components are foundational to the security of new and emerging technologies. RAMP demonstrates just-in-time, scalable, on-demand compute and storage infrastructure, enabling significant reductions in simulation time.

Microsoft’s RAMP platform shows how the application of cloud technologies can meet stringent security, protection and compliance requirements while at the same time significantly shortening chip time to market, bringing benefits in security, innovation and scale.

At a commercial level, the microelectronics industry uses Azure to accelerate and improve the design process for chip manufacturing. Customers routinely use Azure’s infrastructure solutions to optimize design turnaround times, such as high-performance virtual machines and storage, as well as platform solutions that are custom built for silicon design workloads.

In this RAMP demonstration, BAE Systems and Raytheon Technologies demonstrated state-of-the-art, cloud-based design capabilities on the RAMP platform, in collaboration with foundry, IP and electronic design automation partners.

As Katie Sobolewski, BAE R3 product line director, noted, “RAMP helped us meet our design tape-out dates by deploying a tailored cluster of hardware to accelerate our design simulations in hours. Normally, the addition of new hardware on-premises can take months. Access to Azure’s performant compute enabled three times faster runtimes, ultimately ensuring we met our aggressive schedule.”

Built on top of proven rapid and secure cloud-based design capabilities, the RAMP solution implemented innovative technologies in support of the DoD’s Microelectronics Quantified Assurance (MQA) framework. MQA is an evidence-backed risk assessment system that gathers data, from design to manufacturing, to assess the reliability and security of DoD designs.

“We’re leading a technology breakthrough in microelectronics with Microsoft and our industry partners to enable an onshore semiconductor foundry with a state-of-the-art trusted design,” said Van Andrews, vice president of Department 22 at Raytheon Intelligence & Space, a Raytheon Technologies business. “The application of MQA on this program uncovered several opportunities to assure the security of our design. The integration of MQA with Microsoft is a differentiating capability that strengthens the resiliency of microelectronics. In addition, easy onboarding and the simplified interface improve efficiency for users.”

In addition to Microsoft’s Azure cloud technologies, the RAMP demonstration used industry leading microelectronics commercial technologies to develop the end-to-end design solution.  The RAMP partners include: Ansys, Inc., BAE Systems, Battelle Memorial Institute, Cadence Design Systems, Cliosoft, Cycuity, Flex-Logix, Inc., GlobalFoundries, Intel Corporation, Raytheon Technologies, Siemens EDA, Synopsys, Inc., and  Zero ASIC Corporation. These partnerships spanned commercial and government ecosystems enabling the DoD to leverage the best microelectronics development capabilities available.

Microsoft continues to push ahead in advancing secure design and development of critical physical systems for our infrastructure, such as semiconductors and microelectronics. The successful handover of these BAE and Raytheon designs to manufacturing, as part of the RAMP program demonstration, is a major milestone for the industry, as well as the silicon and defense industrial base ecosystem. While the current RAMP program focus now shifts to secure manufacturing, we can now scale the demonstrated secure design capabilities to defense and commercial engineering design projects.

Microsoft and its RAMP commercial industry team partners will continue to bring its combined expertise and experience to transform critical missions, programs, and technologies for DoD.

Announcing the next wave of AI innovation with Microsoft Bing and Edge,"
		Just three months ago, we unveiled the new AI-powered Microsoft Bing and Edge to reinvent the future of search with your copilot for the web. We aimed to tackle a universal problem with traditional search – that nearly half of all web searches go unanswered, resulting in billions of people’s searches falling short of the mark. We launched the new Bing to bring you better search results, answers to your questions, the ability to create and compose, and with a new level of ease of use by being able to chat in natural language.  Bing combines powerful large language models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 with our immense search index for results that are current, cited and conversational – something you can’t get anywhere else but on Bing. This is fundamentally changing the way people find information.
In just 90 days, our customers have engaged in over a half a billion chats, using chat features to get summarized answers to help them with everything from finding the best place to travel for someone with pollen allergies, to organizing the last 10 years of worldwide volcanic activity into a table. We have also seen people create over 200 million images with Bing Image Creator. All up, Bing has grown to exceed 100 million daily active users and daily installs of the Bing mobile app have increased 4X since launch. As a result we are seeing growth of Bing share and it follows the eight straight quarters of growth in our Microsoft Edge browser share. We’re excited about continuing to make Bing more accessible by its introduction to the Windows taskbar, reaching over half a billion customers every month.
Entering the next generation of AI-powered search
Today I’m thrilled to share we are moving to the next generation of AI-powered Bing and Edge to transform the largest category of software in the world – search – by greatly expanding the vision and capabilities we think of as Your Copilot for the Web. This next generation is defined by:

Opening up Bing to more people by moving from Limited Preview to Open Preview and eliminating the waitlist for trial.
Moving from text-only search & chat to one that is incredibly more visual with rich image/video answers and coming shortly, new multimodal support.
Moving from single use chat/search sessions to multi-session productivity experiences with chat history and persistent chats within Edge.
Opening up platform capabilities so developers and third parties can build on top of Bing to help people take actions on their queries and complete tasks.

Bing now in Open Preview
Thanks to tremendous customer adoption, engagement and feedback, we’re ready to take the next step and are announcing the new Bing is now in Open Preview and no longer has a waitlist. This means that it will now be easier than ever for everyone to try the new Bing and Edge by simply signing into Bing with your Microsoft Account.
Making search more visual
We know from research that the human brain processes visual information about 60,000 times faster than text, making visual tools a critical way people search, create and gain understanding. Bing has always been known for its visual experiences including features like Knowledge Cards and visual search. And now we’re delivering those same experiences in chat. We’re introducing richer, more visual answers including charts and graphs and updated formatting of answers, helping you find the information you seek more easily.

We’re also beginning our journey to a redesigned Microsoft Edge where one in four Bing chats originate. Edge continues to be your copilot for the web, the first to use AI, and the only browser with Bing built-in. As these changes begin to roll out, you’ll begin to see a sleeker and enhanced user interface including a streamlined look, rounded corners, organized containers and semi-transparent visual elements.
Lastly, we’re expanding what’s possible with multi-modal capabilities and are beginning the work to incorporate visual search in chat so you will be able to upload images and search the web for related content.
Making search more productive
Two of the most requested features we’ve heard are maintaining access to your chat history and being able to share and export. Starting shortly, you’ll be able to pick up where you left off and return to previous chats in Bing chat with chat history. And when you want to dig into something deeper and open a Bing chat result, your chat will move to your Edge sidebar, so you can keep your chat on hand while you browse. Over time, we’re exploring making your chats more personalized by bringing context from a previous chat into new conversations.

Starting soon, we’re also adding export and share functionalities into chat. For times when you want to easily share your conversation with others in social media or continue iterating on a newly discovered idea, you can export it directly – the format stays the same to make an easy transition to continue in collaborative tools like Microsoft Word.
Chat in Microsoft Edge will also soon have improved summarization capabilities for long documents, including PDFs and longer-form websites, making it easier to consume dense online content. We are also introducing Edge actions. Available in the coming weeks, people will soon be able to lean on AI to complete even more tasks with fewer steps. For example, if you want to watch a particular movie, actions in Edge will find and show you options in chat in the sidebar and then play the movie you want from where it’s available. Edge mobile will also soon include page context, so you can ask questions in Bing chat related to the mobile page you’re viewing. The compose feature in sidebar can also now tailor drafts based on feedback you give like tone, length, phrasing and more.

Moving from a product to a platform
The new AI-powered Bing has already helped people more easily find or create what they are looking for, making chat a great tool for both understanding and taking action. The integration of Image Creator saves you time by completing the task of creating the image you need right within chat.
We’ll soon build third-party plug-ins into the Bing chat experience creating a platform for developers. For example, if you’re researching the latest restaurant for dinner in Bing chat, it will leverage OpenTable to help you find and book a reservation. Or, with Wolfram|Alpha, you can create powerful visualizations and get answers to complex science, math and human-curated data-based questions directly from Bing chat. We are working with our partners at OpenAI to make it easier and as consistent as possible for developers to take advantage of this opportunity. We believe these types of skills are a game-changer in the reinvention of search and to advance opportunities for developers in search. We look forward to sharing more details at Microsoft Build later this month.

Continuing to build in the open, responsibly
As we’ve said from the beginning, responsible AI is at the center of every new experience we build with the new Bing and Edge. And getting the new Bing into preview so we can learn from real-world testing and feedback has been critical to our success and ability to expand the experience to more users. We believe innovating and learning in the open is part of a responsible approach. But we don’t stop there. Together with our partners at OpenAI, we’ve continued to implement safeguards to defend against harmful content based on what we’re learning and seeing in preview. Our teams continue to work to address issues such as misinformation and disinformation, content blocking, data safety and preventing the promotion of harmful or discriminatory content in line with our AI principles. Learn more here about our approach to responsible AI with the new Bing.
If you haven’t tried the new Bing and Edge yet, now is the time to experience firsthand how we’re reinventing search with your copilot for the web. We’ll also continue our thoughtful and measured approach of gathering feedback and making rapid adjustments in preview. We continue to use this feedback to make weekly changes to the preview by incorporating the most requested features and updates and adding new experiences along the way. Experience the future of search by visiting bing.com today or downloading the Bing mobile app in your favorite app store.

The future of manufacturing is now: Four trends shaping the industry,"
		At its core, manufacturing is about innovation, as it builds economic capacity, bolsters workforces, and generates opportunity and growth. Today we’re seeing the industry undergo a once-in-a-century transformation driven by changing consumer demands, labor challenges, supply chain disruptions, technological advancements and sustainability demands. We’ve come a long way since the industrial revolution, and the industry has evolved into a much more complex place.
To explore these challenges and opportunities, we’ll join global leaders and colleagues at the world’s biggest trade show for industrial technology, Hannover Messe. As we enter this week of innovation, we’re discussing four key areas that are reshaping the future of manufacturing: empowering a connected workforce, fueling intelligent engineering and factories with the industrial metaverse, building agile supply chains and accelerating sustainability. Powering these trends is artificial intelligence (AI), which offers more potential for our industry than anything we’ve ever experienced, and we are just scratching the surface of what’s possible.
Here we explore how Microsoft brings these four trends to life to advance the industry:
Empowering the connected workforce
To support intelligent factories, a connected workforce is key, and 63% of frontline manufacturing workers are excited about the job opportunities that technology creates. From the front office to the factory floor, Microsoft solutions can improve operations by streamlining daily work, driving efficiency, safety and productivity as well as helping foster an engaged workforce.
We’re building solutions to address the unique challenges manufacturers face — by helping streamline frontline operations, enhance communication and collaboration, improve the employee experience and strengthen security across shared devices.
Today, we are sharing new capabilities and updates for the workforce, including:

The native integration of AI-empowered Power Virtual Agents (PVA) into Power Apps is now in public preview. AI-infused virtual agents will be readily available in Power Apps, allowing frontline manufacturing workers to easily find intelligent answers within the context of their manufacturing applications.
Leverage Teams as your calling solution to connect with teammates, customers and suppliers. Later this year, factory floor employees will be able to make and receive calls through shared mobile Android phones from wherever their work takes them.

To learn more about how we’re empowering today’s manufacturing workforce, read the latest Microsoft 365 Blog.

Building resilient and agile supply chains
Supply chain disruption is not new; however, its complexity and the rate of change are outpacing organizations’ ability to address issues. Manufacturers are under pressure to prevent and minimize disruptions, and as a result, almost 90 percent of supply chain professionals plan to invest in ways to make their supply chains more resilient.
To support our customers, Microsoft offers solutions like Supply Chain Platform and Supply Chain Center, which enable organizations to reduce risk across complex supply chains and provide a ready-made “command center,” allowing organizations, such as Kraft Heinz, to meet their unique needs without replacing current systems. Additionally, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Copilot gives businesses real-time predictive insights using generative AI across materials, inventory, distribution network and more, which means potential disruptions can be avoided before they happen.
Today, Microsoft is working with customers to improve their supply chain resilience. Semiconductor company STMicroelectronics transformed their supply chain, advanced research and development, and scaled manufacturing leveraging Microsoft Azure HPC. They are now able to bring their products to market faster, and double their capacity by 2025, while becoming carbon neutral by 2027. Toyota Material Handling Europe is bringing warehouse automation to Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, with autonomous guided vehicles that can perform repetitive tasks quickly and accurately, leading to increased efficiency and productivity. This robotics technology can help manage inventory levels, resulting in better stock control and reduced carrying costs.
Learn more about our supply chain solutions from the Dynamics365 team in this blog.

 
People and AI working together: The next generation of intelligent engineering and factories with the industrial metaverse
One of the most significant changes in manufacturing has been the rise of intelligent factories. Imagine an industrial ecosystem connected to a common virtual space that allows everyone to visualize and interact with complex processes in real-time, with real-world data. The industrial metaverse, built with foundational technology like AI, Digital Twins, Mixed Reality, ML and Cloud-To-Edge is changing how companies run and manage their business by delivering immediate value through remote operations and skilling, AI process and asset optimization and robotics, automation, and autonomous operations.
Similarly, the Industrial Metaverse is creating new opportunities to make product engineering more collaborative and immersive. This enables manufacturing companies to reduce and accelerate time-to-market in an increasingly competitive environment.
Our commitment to immersive experiences that support manufacturers and frontline workers continues with today’s announcement that we’re bringing Windows 11 to HoloLens 2, enhancing security and offering the latest tools for developers. We’re also launching new updates to Dynamics 365 Guides, including the ability to annotate anything within arm’s reach, a custom security feature called “Restricted Mode” that gives organizations more control over their mixed reality apps and new updates to Teams calling within Guides to enhance the user experience.
Siemens is using generative AI to help industrial companies drive innovation and efficiency across the design, engineering, manufacturing and operational lifecycle of products. It will bring a Teamcenter app to Microsoft Teams that leverages the language models in Azure OpenAI Service to enhance cross-functional collaboration. In addition, at Hannover Messe we are demonstrating how an Azure AI Service powered assistant can augment the creation, optimization and debugging of code in software for factory automation, and how we can use industrial AI to enable visual quality inspection on the shop floor. Rockwell is integrating robotics and AI technologies to empower companies to optimize their field service workers and asset management in factories. NVIDIA’s Omniverse Cloud makes it easy for teams, from design and engineering to frontline workers, to digitize their workflows, from building digital twins of factories to running closed-loop simulations.

 
Sustainability, energy optimization and fuel cell innovation are more important than ever
Sustainability is a top priority for manufacturers who are adopting eco-friendly practices and implementing initiatives, such as using renewable energy sources, adopting circular economy principles to reduce waste and optimizing production processes to minimize environmental impact.
Through our technology like the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability and our rich partner ecosystem, we are building a critical foundation for an energy efficient and sustainable future. This week, Seeq Corporation announced the Seeq Solution for Microsoft Sustainability Manager, which enables teams to integrate time series process data preparation, analysis and continuous improvement, reducing the environmental impact of process industry operations.
Many of society’s hardest sustainability problems are chemistry and materials science problems that will ultimately require a scaled quantum machine to solve. However, given the continuous increases in classical computing capabilities, more quantum chemistry problems can be solved today using state-of-the-art cloud services. Johnson Matthey, a global leader in sustainable technologies, has teamed-up with Microsoft’s Azure Quantum chemists to develop new predictive modeling tools with the supercomputing capabilities of Azure HPC and refined workflows to accelerate chemical simulations, explore the potential of AI and get quantum ready.
Many manufacturers are facing the urgent situation of rising energy costs on the factory floor and the production plant, which is why we’re working with partners and customers to prioritize top use cases that will help manufacturers gain visibility into where energy loss is occurring and triage the issue through targeted assessments.
These are some of the exciting innovations happening today to help us build a stronger, more resilient and more sustainable tomorrow.
I look forward to seeing many of you at Hannover Messe next week.

Introducing Microsoft Security Copilot: Empowering defenders at the speed of AI,"
		The odds are against today’s defenders
Today the odds remain stacked against cybersecurity professionals. Too often, they fight an asymmetric battle against prolific, relentless and sophisticated attackers. To protect their organizations, defenders must respond to threats that are often hidden among noise. Compounding this challenge is a global shortage of skilled security professionals, leading to an estimated 3.4 million openings in the field.
The volume and velocity of attacks requires us to continually create new technologies that can tip the scales in favor of defenders. Security professionals are scarce, and we must empower them to disrupt attackers’ traditional advantages and drive innovation for their organizations.
In the last few months, the world has witnessed a wave of innovation as organizations apply advanced AI to new technologies and use cases. We are ready for a paradigm shift and taking a massive leap forward by combining Microsoft’s leading security technologies with the latest advancements in AI.
Today, at our inaugural Microsoft Secure event, I am delighted to welcome you to the new era of security — shaped by the power of OpenAI’s GPT-4 generative AI — and thrilled to introduce to you Microsoft Security Copilot.
Security Copilot — end-to-end defense at machine speed and scale
Microsoft Security Copilot is the first security product to enable defenders to move at the speed and scale of AI. Security Copilot combines this advanced large language model (LLM) with a security-specific model from Microsoft. This security-specific model in turn incorporates a growing set of security-specific skills and is informed by Microsoft’s unique global threat intelligence and more than 65 trillion daily signals. Security Copilot also delivers an enterprise-grade security and privacy-compliant experience as it runs on Azure’s hyperscale infrastructure.
When Security Copilot receives a prompt from a security professional, it uses the full power of the security-specific model to deploy skills and queries that maximize the value of the latest large language model capabilities. And this is unique to a security use-case. Our cyber-trained model adds a learning system to create and tune new skills. Security Copilot then can help catch what other approaches might miss and augment an analyst’s work. In a typical incident, this boost translates into gains in the quality of detection, speed of response and ability to strengthen security posture.
Security Copilot doesn’t always get everything right. AI-generated content can contain mistakes. But Security Copilot is a closed-loop learning system, which means it’s continually learning from users and giving them the opportunity to give explicit feedback with the feedback feature that is built directly into the tool. As we continue to learn from these interactions, we are adjusting its responses to create more coherent, relevant and useful answers.
Security Copilot also integrates with the end-to-end Microsoft Security products, and over time it will expand to a growing ecosystem of third-party products. So, in short, Security Copilot is not only a large language model, but rather a system that learns, to enable organizations to truly defend at machine speed.
We absolutely believe that security is a team sport, and security should be built with privacy at the core. We’ve built Security Copilot with security teams in mind— your data is always your data and stays within your control. It is not used to train the foundation AI models, and in fact, it is protected by the most comprehensive enterprise compliance and security controls. While remaining private, each user interaction can be easily shared with other team members to accelerate incident response, collaborate more effectively on complex problems and develop collective skills.
Technology that elevates human strengths
Human creativity and knowledge will always be imperative for defense. Security Copilot can augment security professionals with machine speed and scale, so human ingenuity is deployed where it matters most. In delivering this experience, we are guided by three principles:

Simplify the complex.
In security, minutes count. With Security Copilot, defenders can respond to security incidents within minutes instead of hours or days. Security Copilot delivers critical step-by-step guidance and context through a natural language-based investigation experience that accelerates incident investigation and response. The ability to quickly summarize any process or event and tune reporting to suit a desired audience frees defenders to focus on the most pressing work.
Catch what others miss.
Attackers hide behind noise and weak signals. Defenders can now discover malicious behavior and threat signals that could otherwise go undetected. Security Copilot surfaces prioritized threats in real time and anticipates a threat actor’s next move with continuous reasoning based on Microsoft’s global threat intelligence. Security Copilot also comes with skills that represent the expertise of security analysts in areas such as threat hunting, incident response and vulnerability management.
Address the talent gap.
A security team’s capacity will always be limited by the team’s size and the natural limits of human attention. Security Copilot boosts your defenders’ skills with its ability to answer security-related questions – from the basic to the complex. Security Copilot continually learns from user interactions, adapts to enterprise preferences, and advises defenders on the best course of action to achieve more secure outcomes. It also supports learning for new team members as it exposes them to new skills and approaches as they develop. This enables security teams to do more with less, and to operate with the capabilities of a larger, more mature organization.

Unrivaled security capabilities
With Security Copilot, we are taking the agility advantage back to defenders by combining Microsoft leading security technologies with the latest advancements in AI. By working with Security Copilot, organizations get access to an unrivaled depth and breadth of security AI capabilities, including:

Ongoing access to the most advanced OpenAI models to support the most demanding security tasks and applications
A security-specific model that benefits from continuous reinforcement, learning and user feedback to meet the unique needs of security professionals;
Visibility and evergreen threat intelligence powered by your organization’s security products and the 65 trillion threat signals Microsoft sees every day to ensure that security teams are operating with the latest knowledge of attackers, their tactics, techniques, and procedures;
Integration with Microsoft’s end-to-end security portfolio for a highly efficient experience that builds on the security signals;
A growing list of unique skills and prompts that elevate the expertise of security teams and set the bar higher for what is possible even under limited resources.

Delivering security AI in a responsible way
Without a doubt, AI will transform how organizations around the world interact with security technologies. To achieve their highest potential, security AI solutions must be delivered in a safe, secure and responsible way. With Security Copilot, we reinforce our commitment to impactful and responsible AI practices by innovating responsibly, empowering others, and fostering positive impact.
The cornerstone of this work is our commitment to how Security Copilot handles your data:

Your data is your data. It’s yours to own and control, and yours to choose how you want to leverage and monetize.
Your data is not used to train or enrich foundation AI models used by others – no one beyond your organization is benefiting from AI trained on your data or business processes.
Your data and AI models are protected at every step by the most comprehensive enterprise compliance and security controls in the industry.

The new era of security
At Microsoft, we believe that security is ultimately about people. With Security Copilot, we are building a future where every defender is empowered with the technologies and expertise that enable them to reach their full potential. Technology will play an essential role on this journey, but successful security is, and will continue to be, a human endeavor.
We’re excited to be on this journey with you and we look forward to sharing more soon. Welcome to the new era of security.

Create images with your words – Bing Image Creator comes to the new Bing,"Last month we introduced the new AI-powered Bing and Microsoft Edge, your copilot for the web – delivering better search, complete answers, a new chat experience and the ability to create content. Already, we have seen that chat is reinventing how people search with more than 100 million chats to date. We’ve seen people use chat in a variety of ways, from refining answers to complex questions to using it as a form of entertainment or for creative inspiration. Today we’re taking the chat experience to the next level by making the new Bing more visual.

We’re excited to announce we are bringing Bing Image Creator, new AI-powered visual Stories and updated Knowledge Cards to the new Bing and Edge preview. Powered by an advanced version of the DALL∙E model from our partners at OpenAI, Bing Image Creator allows you to create an image simply by using your own words to describe the picture you want to see. Now you can generate both written and visual content in one place, from within chat.

We know from research that the human brain processes visual information about 60,000 times faster than text, making visual tools a critical way people search, create and gain understanding. Based on Bing data, images are one of the most searched categories – second only to general web searches. Historically, search was limited to images that already existed on the web. Now, there are almost no limits to what you can search for and create.

For those in the Bing preview, Bing Image Creator will be fully integrated into the Bing chat experience, rolling out initially in Creative mode. By typing in a description of an image, providing additional context like location or activity, and choosing an art style, Image Creator will generate an image from your own imagination. It’s like your creative copilot. Just type something like “draw an image” or “create an image” as a prompt in chat to get creating a visual for a newsletter to friends or as inspiration for redecorating your living room.

 

Bing Image Creator preview will also be available in Microsoft Edge, making it the first and only browser with an integrated AI-powered image generator. To use Bing Image Creator in Edge, simply click the Bing Image Creator icon in the sidebar to create your image or invoke from Bing chat in Edge.

 

At Microsoft, our teams are guided by our Responsible AI principles and the Responsible AI Standard to help them develop and deploy AI systems responsibly. To curb the potential misuse of Image creator, we are working together with our partner OpenAI, who developed DALL∙E, to deliver an experience that encourages responsible use of Image Creator. We have ensured OpenAI’s safeguards, plus additional protections, have been incorporated into Image Creator. For example, we have put controls in place that aim to limit the generation of harmful or unsafe images. When our system detects that a potentially harmful image could be generated by a prompt, it blocks the prompt and warns the user. We also make it clear that Image Creator’s images are generated by AI, and we include a modified Bing icon in the bottom left corner of each image to help indicate that the image was created using Image Creator. We continue to work closely with OpenAI to build, test and review mitigations for our integrations.

Since making the new Bing available in preview, we have been testing it with people to get real-world feedback to learn and improve the experience. People used it in some ways we expected and others we didn’t. In this spirit of learning and continuing to build new capabilities responsibly, we’re rolling out Bing Image Creator in a phased approach by flighting with a set of preview users before expanding more broadly. We will initially only include Image Creator in the Creative mode of Bing chat and our intention is to make it available in Balanced and Precise mode over time. We are also working on some ongoing optimizations for how Image Creator works in multi-turn chats. We continue to believe the best way to bring these technologies to market is to test them carefully, in the open, where everyone can provide feedback.

New AI-Powered Visual Stories and Knowledge Cards

To support the growing demand for more visual search experiences, we are also making Stories and Knowledge Cards 2.0 available to all Bing users. Stories provide a more engaging way to search and interact with content, offering images and short videos. Also new to Bing users today, Knowledge Cards 2.0 is an AI-powered infographic-inspired experience that provides fun facts and key information at a glance. It’s been updated to include interactive, dynamic content like charts, graphs, timelines, visual stories and more. With these updates and more coming, our goal is to deliver more immersive experiences in Bing and Edge that make finding answers and exploring the web more interesting, useful and fun.

 

Availability

Bing Image Creator integrated into Bing chat will begin to roll out to Bing preview users on both desktop and mobile starting today. For those not in the new Bing preview, the preview experience of Image Creator is now available at bing.com/create for Bing users around the world in English. We will add more language support over time.

Bing Image Creator is also available in Microsoft Edge from the Image Creator icon in sidebar for both desktop and mobile starting today for Edge users around the world in English. We will also soon integrate Image Creator into Edge from the new Bing button in chat mode in the preview version of Edge.

If you’re not yet in the new Bing preview, you can sign up for the waitlist today. We’re adding more people every day. Thanks for your continued feedback and we look forward to sharing more updates soon.

Prompts for communicators using the new AI-powered Bing,"Summary
The new Bing, your AI-powered copilot for the web, is now in preview, and you might be surprised at how much it can help us be better at our craft of communications.
These are some starter prompts to ask Bing, which have helped me and my team in our work over the past few weeks.
If you like the answers you find with Bing, remember to follow-up with the source links for more information.
The new Bing is in preview, and we’re continuing to take feedback and apply those learnings to improve the experience over time.

We’re in the thick of it, for sure. As communications professionals, we’re figuring out what this new age of AI means for us, for our craft, while at the same time trying to explain AI to the world.

In speaking at an event this week in New York on this topic, one of the things I reflected on was the need to bring people along on this change curve. You might start off on the curve like “nope” – as soon as you start seeing stories about these AI advancements, your response is that this is not good for our profession. But then as you dig into it, you feel maybe it’s not a “nope” and move up the curve to “there’s hope.” There are all sorts of things I could do! After all, one of our secret powers as communicators has always been language. And you have this moment and realize, you can accelerate this secret power with AI.

Here’s how I’ve been doing just that with these prompts using the new AI-powered Bing. The results were crazy impressive. Try for yourself by signing up for the preview at bing.com/new and remember to give feedback directly to Bing so we can continue to improve the experience.

Useful information to get started
Choose a conversation style: “More Creative,” “More Balanced” or “More Precise”
The new Bing won’t hesitate to offer some follow-up questions to help hone in on the answer you’re looking for. For example, when you’re using the new Bing to do idea generation, it’s helpful to follow-up by asking it to “give me a few more.”
Related to that, don’t leave Bing hanging! It may have an ancillary topic related to the topic you’re asking about.
Bing will always show you where it’s getting its information, so if you like some of the answers you’re getting and want more details, don’t forget to check out the sources that Bing is pulling from.
Reminder! Avoid putting confidential information in the chat.

Next, on to the prompts.

Media interview prep

This first example comes from The Wall Street Journal reporter Joanna Stern. To prepare for an interview with our Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella, Joanna used the new Bing to help with preparing interview questions. Here’s what she asked Bing:

“In the voice of Joanna Stern, generate a list of 10 interview questions for Satya Nadella about AI and the new Bing”
“Answer question 5 in the voice of <person>”

Since then, I’ve been using similar prompts to prepare for media interviews. For example, in preparing for this On With Kara Swisher podcast episode, here’s a prompt that I used:

“Help me prepare for a podcast interview with Kara Swisher. The topic we’ve agreed to discuss is the rise of Artificial Intelligence tools and services. Based on her most recent writing and podcasts, give me 10 questions I should anticipate.”

Remember, you have enough time to make sure Bing is prepared – so it can help to first ask if it’s familiar with Kara Swisher and her interview style. Then add more details – who is she talking to? Then fire the prompt about the 10 questions.

Media coverage snapshots

It’s been a crazy few weeks of news here at Microsoft and I’ve started using Bing to help me get quick snapshots of media coverage to see how news is landing in the moment. Here are a few examples I pulled recently:

“What’s the latest news about <X> today?”
“What’s the overall tone of these stories?”
“How does this compare with news about <Y> in the same time period?”

This is not a substitute for deeper measurement or analysis, but it’s a surprisingly good first snap when you need something now.

Social media post inspiration

Bing chat is also a great brainstorm idea generator. We’ve experimented using it to get inspiration for our social media posts, especially with “More Creative” mode. Here are some examples that my team has experimented with:

“Generate a few tweets that include <X> information and uses a <Y> tone” (such as “lighthearted tone”)
“Write a LinkedIn post for this blog, <X>”
“Generate a few tweet ideas for <company> about <product feature>”
“Take the following information and turn it into a <X> character tweet / LinkedIn post: <copy and paste text>,” then “Can you write it again but make it more engaging?”

These initial prompts are usually followed by “give me a few more versions.”

Headline generation

There are days when I spend a lot of time writing (and rewriting) the body of a blog post, finally get it to a good place and only then start to wonder, what is my headline? By this point I’ve used up every ounce of creativity and begrudgingly write something somewhat coherent and feel slightly bad about myself. But these days, I feel less bad. While I still spend a lot of time writing (I really do love writing!) now with the new Bing, I’ve been using this prompt to help me generate headlines (a type of writing that I love less). Here’s what I did:

“Suggest a few variations of headlines for the following,”
Copy your text and paste it to the Bing chat

FAQ generation

FAQs is another type of writing I’ve been keen to accelerate with AI. Here’s how I’ve done that:

“Suggest five FAQs for <text or link>”
“Give me a few more”

I hope these prompt examples help you kickstart your own questions and interactions with this incredible new tool.

Happy experimenting!

Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot – your copilot for work,"
		Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate. Each of us seeks to do work that gives us purpose — to write a great novel, to make a discovery, to build strong communities, to care for the sick. The urge to connect to the core of our work lives in all of us. But today, we spend too much time consumed by the drudgery of work on tasks that zap our time, creativity and energy. To reconnect to the soul of our work, we don’t just need a better way of doing the same things. We need a whole new way to work.
Today, we are bringing the power of next-generation AI to work. Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot — your copilot for work. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the planet.
“Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing, which will fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “With our new copilot for work, we’re giving people more agency and making technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language.”
Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 in two ways. It works alongside you, embedded in the Microsoft 365 apps you use every day — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more — to unleash creativity, unlock productivity and uplevel skills. Today we’re also announcing an entirely new experience: Business Chat. Business Chat works across the LLM, the Microsoft 365 apps, and your data — your calendar, emails, chats, documents, meetings and contacts — to do things you’ve never been able to do before. You can give it natural language prompts like “Tell my team how we updated the product strategy,” and it will generate a status update based on the morning’s meetings, emails and chat threads.
With Copilot, you’re always in control. You decide what to keep, modify or discard. Now, you can be more creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook and more collaborative in Teams.

Microsoft 365 Copilot transforms work in three ways:
Unleash creativity. With Copilot in Word, you can jump-start the creative process so you never start with a blank slate again. Copilot gives you a first draft to edit and iterate on — saving hours in writing, sourcing, and editing time. Sometimes Copilot will be right, other times usefully wrong — but it will always put you further ahead. You’re always in control as the author, driving your unique ideas forward, prompting Copilot to shorten, rewrite or give feedback. Copilot in PowerPoint helps you create beautiful presentations with a simple prompt, adding relevant content from a document you made last week or last year. And with Copilot in Excel, you can analyze trends and create professional-looking data visualizations in seconds.
Unlock productivity. We all want to focus on the 20% of our work that really matters, but 80% of our time is consumed with busywork that bogs us down. Copilot lightens the load. From summarizing long email threads to quickly drafting suggested replies, Copilot in Outlook helps you clear your inbox in minutes, not hours. And every meeting is a productive meeting with Copilot in Teams. It can summarize key discussion points — including who said what and where people are aligned and where they disagree — and suggest action items, all in real time during a meeting. And with Copilot in Power Platform, anyone can automate repetitive tasks, create chatbots and go from idea to working app in minutes.
GitHub data shows that Copilot promises to unlock productivity for everyone. Among developers who use GitHub Copilot, 88% say they are more productive, 74% say that they can focus on more satisfying work, and 77% say it helps them spend less time searching for information or examples.
But Copilot doesn’t just supercharge individual productivity. It creates a new knowledge model for every organization — harnessing the massive reservoir of data and insights that lies largely inaccessible and untapped today. Business Chat works across all your business data and apps to surface the information and insights you need from a sea of data — so knowledge flows freely across the organization, saving you valuable time searching for answers. You will be able to access Business Chat from Microsoft 365.com, from Bing when you’re signed in with your work account, or from Teams.
Uplevel skills. Copilot makes you better at what you’re good at and lets you quickly master what you’ve yet to learn. The average person uses only a handful of commands — such as “animate a slide” or “insert a table” — from the thousands available across Microsoft 365. Now, all that rich functionality is unlocked using just natural language. And this is only the beginning.
Copilot will fundamentally change how people work with AI and how AI works with people. As with any new pattern of work, there’s a learning curve — but those who embrace this new way of working will quickly gain an edge.

The Copilot System: Enterprise-ready AI
Microsoft is uniquely positioned to deliver enterprise-ready AI with the Copilot System. Copilot is more than OpenAI’s ChatGPT embedded into Microsoft 365. It’s a sophisticated processing and orchestration engine working behind the scenes to combine the power of LLMs, including GPT-4, with the Microsoft 365 apps and your business data in the Microsoft Graph — now accessible to everyone through natural language.
Grounded in your business data. AI-powered LLMs are trained on a large but limited corpus of data. The key to unlocking productivity in business lies in connecting LLMs to your business data — in a secure, compliant, privacy-preserving way. Microsoft 365 Copilot has real-time access to both your content and context in the Microsoft Graph. This means it generates answers anchored in your business content — your documents, emails, calendar, chats, meetings, contacts and other business data — and combines them with your working context — the meeting you’re in now, the email exchanges you’ve had on a topic, the chat conversations you had last week — to deliver accurate, relevant, contextual responses.
Built on Microsoft’s comprehensive approach to security, compliance and privacy. Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 and automatically inherits all your company’s valuable security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. Two-factor authentication, compliance boundaries, privacy protections, and more make Copilot the AI solution you can trust.
Architected to protect tenant, group and individual data. We know data leakage is a concern for customers. Copilot LLMs are not trained on your tenant data or your prompts. Within your tenant, our time-tested permissioning model ensures that data won’t leak across user groups. And on an individual level, Copilot presents only data you can access using the same technology that we’ve been using for years to secure customer data.
Integrated into the apps millions use every day. Microsoft 365 Copilot is integrated in the productivity apps millions of people use and rely on every day for work and life — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more. An intuitive and consistent user experience ensures it looks, feels and behaves the same way in Teams as it does in Outlook, with a shared design language for prompts, refinements and commands.
Designed to learn new skills. Microsoft 365 Copilot’s foundational skills are a game changer for productivity: It can already create, summarize, analyze, collaborate and automate using your specific business content and context. But it doesn’t stop there. Copilot knows how to command apps (e.g., “animate this slide”) and work across apps, translating a Word document into a PowerPoint presentation. And Copilot is designed to learn new skills. For example, with Viva Sales, Copilot can learn how to connect to CRM systems of record to pull customer data — like interaction and order histories — into communications. As Copilot learns about new domains and processes, it will be able to perform even more sophisticated tasks and queries.
Committed to building responsibly
At Microsoft, we are guided by our AI principles and Responsible AI Standard and decades of research on AI, grounding and privacy-preserving machine learning. A multidisciplinary team of researchers, engineers and policy experts reviews our AI systems for potential harms and mitigations — refining training data, filtering to limit harmful content, query- and result-blocking sensitive topics, and applying Microsoft technologies like InterpretML and Fairlearn to help detect and correct data bias. We make it clear how the system makes decisions by noting limitations, linking to sources, and prompting users to review, fact-check and adjust content based on subject-matter expertise.
Moving boldly as we learn 
In the months ahead, we’re bringing Copilot to all our productivity apps—Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, Viva, Power Platform, and more. We’ll share more on pricing and licensing soon. Earlier this month we announced Dynamics 365 Copilot as the world’s first AI Copilot in both CRM and ERP to bring the next-generation AI to every line of business.
Everyone deserves to find purpose and meaning in their work — and Microsoft 365 Copilot can help. To serve the unmet needs of our customers, we must move quickly and responsibly, learning as we go. We’re testing Copilot with a small group of customers to get feedback and improve our models as we scale, and we will expand to more soon.

"Introducing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Copilot, the world’s first copilot in both CRM and ERP, that brings next-generation AI to every line of business","
		Today, we’re announcing the next generation of AI product updates across our business applications portfolio, including the launch of the new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Copilot – providing interactive, AI-powered assistance across business functions.
According to our recent survey on business trends, nearly 9 out of 10 workers hope to use AI to reduce repetitive tasks in their jobs. With Dynamics 365 Copilot, organizations empower their workers with AI tools built for sales, service, marketing, operations and supply chain roles. These AI capabilities allow everyone to spend more time on the best parts of their jobs and less time on mundane tasks.
Customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have long been mission-critical customer and business data sources; however, they frequently require burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation and notetaking. Dynamics 365 Copilot takes advantage of recent advancements in generative AI to automate these tedious tasks and unlock the full creativity of the workforce. Dynamics 365 Copilot puts CRM and ERP to work for business users to accelerate their pace of innovation and improve business outcomes in every line of business:

Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Sales and Viva Sales helps sellers dramatically reduce the time they spend on clerical tasks. AI helps write email responses to customers and can even create an email summary of a Teams meeting in Outlook. The meeting summary pulls in details from the seller’s CRM such as product and pricing information, as well as insights from the recorded Teams call. With sellers spending as much as 66% of their day checking and responding to emails, this presents a significant business upside to give the seller more time with their customers.
Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service empowers agents to deliver exceptional customer care. Dynamics 365 Copilot drafts contextual answers to queries in both chat and email, in addition to providing an interactive chat experience over knowledge bases and case history so this AI-powered expertise is always available to answer questions. We’re also making it easier for customer service departments to build virtual agents in minutes with conversation boosters in Power Virtual Agents, which harnesses the power of Azure OpenAI Service and Bing to provide answers from company websites and internal knowledge bases that you choose.
Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights and Dynamics 365 Marketing empowers marketers to simplify their workflow in data exploration, audience segmentation and content creation.

With Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Insights, marketers can curate highly personalized and targeted customer segments by having a dialogue with their customer data platform using natural language. Marketers can receive suggestions about additional segments that may not have been previously considered. This new capability can handle complex calculations and match customers that fit a select profile.
Using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Marketing, marketers can describe their customer segment in their own words to create a target segment with the query assist feature. Marketers can also use Dynamics 365 Copilot to effortlessly get inspiration for fresh email campaign content based on a simple request. Copilot makes suggestions based on key topics entered by the marketer, the organization’s existing marketing emails, as well as from a range of internet sources to increase the relevance of generated ideas.


Copilot in Dynamics 365 Business Central streamlines the creation of product listings for online commerce. Product attributes such as color, material and size can be used to create compelling product descriptions for online storefronts in seconds. The descriptions can be further tailored by choosing tone of voice, format and length. Business Central customers using Shopify can seamlessly publish the products with descriptions to their Shopify store in just a few clicks.
Lastly, Copilot in Microsoft Supply Chain Center, which Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management customers can access, will proactively flag external issues such as weather, financials and geography that may impact key supply chain processes. Predictive insights then surface impacted orders across materials, inventory, carrier, distribution network and more. Supply chain planners can then automatically draft an email generated by Dynamics 365 Copilot to alert impacted partners and mitigate potential disruptions before they happen.

The next era of business applications is being transformed by generative AI. Users will increasingly expect their CRM and ERP applications to include AI-powered expertise. Dynamics 365 Copilot brings the latest AI breakthroughs to every line of business, improving customer experience, employee experience and operational efficiency. Essential to our approach as we bring these latest advancements to customers is our commitment to responsible AI by design – our framework for the safe deployment of AI technologies.
Today’s announcement builds on recent AI momentum across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and the Power Platform. This includes: the next generation of AI capabilities in Microsoft Teams, the collaboration platform for work with more than 280 million monthly active users; Viva Sales, which helps sellers by bringing a sales copilot to their flow of work in Microsoft 365; and Power Apps, enabling citizen developers to write code using natural language.

From gatekeeper to innovator: How finance teams are using technology to drive strategic innovation,"Chief financial officer (CFO) and finance teams are typically known for their fiscal duties – accounting, expenses and financial planning – that help ensure an organization is compliant and runs smoothly for long-term financial health. Over the past few years, the role of finance teams has drastically evolved to include driving innovation. During the pandemic, CFO guidance was critical to keep organizations running – by closely monitoring revenue and expenses and at times, making tough business decisions. Now, these teams are being asked to expand their role to become futurists and play a leading role in transformation.  To learn more about this evolution, Microsoft conducted a survey with U.S. finance leaders to get their perspective on the future of finance.

In Microsoft’s new Economic Guardians of the Future report, we examined how financial teams and leaders are working today, challenges they’re facing, and the role of technology in their day-to-day lives. What we found is that CFOs and their teams are facing a new, urgent directive: striking the right balance between strategic innovation while protecting the long-term financial health of their organizations – all during an uncertain economic climate.

Striking the right balance: Economic guardian and innovation driver
In our research, we uncovered that most finance leaders feel they are being asked to deliver on conflicting objectives – to accelerate the pace of innovation while also ensuring brand trust and mitigating risks. They must both reduce costs and increase growth to deliver short-term profit and long-term vision and corporate purpose. Despite their reputation as risk-averse adversaries to innovation, 79% of finance leaders believe that to meet future needs they must play a significant role in owning business innovation and empowering transformation across the organization.  Now more than ever CFOs and their teams are focused on transformation and the future.

We’re already seeing this evolution in customers we partner closely with. London Stock Exchange Group’s (LSEG) CFO Anna Manz’s role goes beyond performance management and driving an efficient function into delivering the big strategic decisions. Most recently this included LSEG’s collaboration with Microsoft to empower financial markets with next generation data, analytics and workspace solutions. It is challenging LSEG to think about how they can work with customers and develop products differently, and it’s crucial that a cross-functional team including finance understand the scale of the opportunity and the capability to execute. Combining LSEG’s unparalleled depth and breadth of financial data and analytics and deep knowledge of financial services, paired with Microsoft’s technology and embedded Microsoft office workflow, creates a tremendous opportunity to bring critical transformation in the financial services industry.

Drive employee satisfaction through AI and automation
While finance teams are being asked to take on more than ever, they are not seeing incremental increases in people resourcing. Striking the balance between automation and an organization’s most important asset — its people — is key for the future of finance.​ Doing more with less isn’t about overburdening an already taxed workforce, it’s about augmenting human capabilities with automation, enabling employees to move business forward.​ Eighty-two percent of finance leaders found AI and automation very important to helping evolve their team’s role to support their organization’s strategic goals.  Implementing AI and automation can free up valuable time for finance teams to focus on work that drives business strategy and modernization.

As finance professionals seek more ways to work smarter, not harder, low code automation tools remove IT barriers. Empowered with automation and AI, people are more connected, collaborative and ready to tackle more strategic work.

Agility and innovation are crucial when facing the unexpected
Business agility is essential, and finance teams are doubling down their efforts to keep up with shifting markets. Organizational health has become increasingly dependent on connected data, efficient processes and action-oriented insights that facilitate agile, data-driven decision making.

Microsoft’s Economic Guardians of the Future report found that 88% of financial leaders feel overwhelmed by their organization’s data. To address this need, Microsoft is announcing the first of many new capabilities in Dynamics 365 Finance: Business performance analytics which empowers finance professionals by equipping them with faster reporting and analytics. This new capability streamlines financial reporting by centralizing data from multiple business workstreams into an easy-to-use interface. Powered by Dataverse, this capability enables users to create and share personalized reports, and get secure, near real-time access to critical financial information. With improved visibility, finance teams can make informed decisions and provide timely financial insights to business leaders.

But this product advancement couldn’t be done without our customers’ partnership. Robert Walters, a global recruitment and talent management company, is a prime example of how innovative technology and agility helps CFOs drive strong cross-functional partnerships and digital transformation. Robert Walters partnered with Microsoft to replace their entire finance platform, all during the pandemic. The results? An on-time, in-budget success, which led to streamlining the delivery of information to teams, enabled real-time data visibility, and in one specific instance an annual cost savings of 150,000 pounds. By utilizing innovative technologies and fostering a strategic partnership between the CFO and chief information officer, the company effectively unified data and information, driving faster, data-driven decision-making. With this hyper-connect business approach their recruiters have the information they need to drive better outcomes for recruits and clients.

Empower your workforce by prioritizing job fulfillment, collaboration and faster innovation
It comes as no surprise that employees want to spend less time on repetitive and transactional tasks, and more time working as a team to drive better business decisions.

At Microsoft, we’ve been on this journey for years, transforming our finance operations using our cloud-based products including Azure, Excel, Power Platform, Dynamics 365 and Teams — something we call Modern Finance. But this goes beyond technology. We are reimagining what is possible and that required a cultural shift to reevaluate our processes, alleviate pain points, foster a culture of learning and innovation, and empower our people to do their best work. One highlight is that we have many citizen developers on our finance team who are leveraging low-code technology to transform business processes. These initiatives have saved us over 977 hours of manual labor annually, with over $25 million in savings and a huge boost in productivity.

When we combine people, processes, and tools — this is where the real magic happens. Don’t underestimate the importance of culture, how to build a team and a culture that allows learning, sets the pace of industry-wide transformations and encourages innovation.

Modern Finance is here to stay
We are living through a period of historic economic, societal, and technological change, but for all the uncertainty we continue to see in the world one thing is clear: Business leaders are turning to finance and innovative technology to help them do more with less, to navigate the unexpected and emerge much stronger. Financial transformation is a journey, not a destination.

The new Bing preview experience arrives on Bing and Edge Mobile apps; introducing Bing now in Skype,"Two weeks ago, we introduced the world to the all new AI-powered Bing and Microsoft Edge — your copilot for the web. Since then, based on strong and positive product feedback and engagement, we’ve welcomed more than one million people in 169 countries off the waitlist into the preview.  We continue to expand the preview to more people every day. Our preview community is actively using the breadth of new features across Search, Answers, Chat and Creation with total engagement up significantly. Feedback on the new capabilities is positive, with 71% of testers giving the new Bing a “thumbs up” on the new search and answers capabilities. We’re even more excited about the breadth of feedback we are receiving on where and how we can improve and we are acting on it with regular updates.

We’re seeing some interesting use cases and queries in preview testing. I recently learned about a father showing his son the new Bing, and together they discovered and created in a way not easily done with today’s search engines. They started off by creating sci-fi stories using simple prompts in chat, eventually leading to the development of a video game idea where Bing not only helped create a plot, but also generated the code to input directly into Scratch – a visual programming tool. In just a few queries, they captured the wonder and potential of the new Bing and Edge. We are hearing many similar stories on how the new Bing is helping people discover and create in ways previously not possible.

Sign up for the new Bing and Edge mobile apps

In this spirit of learning and continuing to build new capabilities, we’re excited to share today the preview release of the new Bing and Edge mobile apps.  We’re beginning to roll out the incredible capabilities of the new Bing and Edge on your smartphone along with some exciting new features, such as voice input. In addition, we are creating a new chat experience, beginning with Skype, to enhance your social communications with your friends and family.

The new Bing and Edge goes mobile; Now introducing voice access

Because we know 64% of searches occur on mobile phones, we are releasing all new Bing and Edge mobile apps to serve as your copilot for the web even when you are away from your desktop.

Imagine an unexpected layover in a new city. As you plan a quick afternoon stop in Tokyo, you ask Bing to help find a place to store your luggage. It then provides tips for navigating the metro system on your way to the famed Shinjuku station. With a few hours to explore, Bing creates a short itinerary, helping you get the most out of your quick visit, and even translates along the way.

Available on iOS and Android today, the Bing mobile app offers a fresh look and experience. Tapping the Bing icon at the bottom will invoke a chat session, where you can engage in all the same ways you can from the desktop. Ask simple or complex questions and receive answers and citations. Choose how you want your answers displayed – bullet points, text or simplified responses. Explore the Bing chat experience to refine your query or compose an email, poem or list.

With the introduction of the new Bing mobile app, we’re adding one of the preview community’s most requested features – voice. Available on mobile and on desktop, voice search provides more versatility in how you can deliver prompts and receive answers from Bing.

In addition, those who have access to the preview will be able to utilize the new Bing experience from the homepage of the Microsoft Edge mobile app.

Bing goes social with Skype

To better assist you when you are collaborating with friends and family, we are introducing AI-powered Bing for Skype. More than 36 million people use Skype daily to connect through phone calls and chats across borders and around the world and the new Bing is going to enable some helpful and fun new scenarios and capabilities.

Imagine having a copilot for your friends and family as you stay connected and plan your next get together. Simply add Bing to the group, as you would any Skype contact, and now you can ask Bing to answer questions and provide information for the entire group. For example, if your family is chatting about the next family reunion, you can simply ask Bing for suggestions on travel destinations, expected weather forecasts and interesting events around your time of travel, and everyone in the chat will get access to the results. When you are catching up with friends, you can ask Bing to simply fetch information from the web, for example, the latest news or last night’s award shows to add to your conversation.

You can choose how you want your answers to be displayed – bullet points, text or a simplified response. Bing can accommodate your preferences. Fluent in more than 100 languages, and capable of translating between them, Bing can offer unique value to this global communications tool.

Available worldwide in preview today, the new Bing in Skype can provide helpful, real-time answers to all your questions. As we learn and fine-tune this amazing new capability, we envision bringing it to other communications apps, like Teams, in the future.

If you’re currently on the Bing preview experience, these features are available to you later today. In the first few days of testing these mobile experiences, you may occasionally find connectivity issues in low-bandwidth situations. We’re aware of the issue and are working on a fix.

If you’re among those awaiting access, we appreciate both your patience and your excitement. We’re working as fast as possible to onboard more people every day. If you’re interested in trying it for yourself, please sign up for the Bing preview today.  We hope you enjoy the new capabilities and please keep the feedback coming so we can continue to improve the product for you.

*Skype user interface will vary during initial rollout.

"Reinventing search with a new AI-powered Microsoft Bing and Edge, your copilot for the web","To empower people to unlock the joy of discovery, feel the wonder of creation and better harness the world’s knowledge, today we’re improving how the world benefits from the web by reinventing the tools billions of people use every day, the search engine and the browser.

Today, we’re launching an all new, AI-powered Bing search engine and Edge browser, available in preview now at Bing.com, to deliver better search, more complete answers, a new chat experience and the ability to generate content. We think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web.

“AI will fundamentally change every software category, starting with the largest category of all – search,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “Today, we’re launching Bing and Edge powered by AI copilot and chat, to help people get more from search and the web.”

There are 10 billion search queries a day, but we estimate half of them go unanswered. That’s because people are using search to do things it wasn’t originally designed to do. It’s great for finding a website, but for more complex questions or tasks too often it falls short.

The new Bing and Edge – Your copilot for the web

We have brought together search, browsing and chat into one unified experience you can invoke from anywhere on the web, delivering:

Better search. The new Bing gives you an improved version of the familiar search experience, providing more relevant results for simple things like sports scores, stock prices and weather, along with a new sidebar that shows more comprehensive answers if you want them.
Complete answers. Bing reviews results from across the web to find and summarize the answer you’re looking for. For example, you can get detailed instructions for how to substitute eggs for another ingredient in a cake you are baking right in that moment, without scrolling through multiple results.
A new chat experience. For more complex searches – such as for planning a detailed trip itinerary or researching what TV to buy – the new Bing offers new, interactive chat. The chat experience empowers you to refine your search until you get the complete answer you are looking for by asking for more details, clarity and ideas – with links available so you can immediately act on your decisions.
A creative spark. There are times when you need more than an answer – you need inspiration. The new Bing can generate the content to help you. It can help you write an email, create a 5-day itinerary for a dream vacation to Hawaii, with links to book your travel and accommodations, prep for a job interview or create a quiz for trivia night. The new Bing also cites all its sources, so you’re able to see links to the web content it references.
New Microsoft Edge experience. We’ve updated the Edge browser with new AI capabilities and a new look, and we’ve added two new functionalities: Chat and compose. With the Edge Sidebar, you can ask for a summary of a lengthy financial report to get the key takeaways – and then use the chat function to ask for a comparison to a competing company’s financials and automatically put it in a table. You can also ask Edge to help you compose content, such as a LinkedIn post, by giving it a few prompts to get you started. After that, you can ask it to help you update the tone, format and length of the post. Edge can understand the web page you’re on and adapts accordingly.


With the new Bing, exploring the web isn’t just easier, it’s also more fun. Ask it things like:

My anniversary is coming up in September, help me plan a trip somewhere fun in Europe, leaving from London.

Will the Ikea Klippan loveseat fit into my 2019 Honda Odyssey?

I like electronic music and want to go to my first festival this year. Do you have any recommendations or tips for me?

Reinventing search with AI

The new Bing experience is a culmination of four technical breakthroughs:

Next-generation OpenAI model. We’re excited to announce the new Bing is running on a new, next-generation OpenAI large language model that is more powerful than ChatGPT and customized specifically for search. It takes key learnings and advancements from ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 – and it is even faster, more accurate and more capable.
Microsoft Prometheus model. We have developed a proprietary way of working with the OpenAI model that allows us to best leverage its power. We call this collection of capabilities and techniques the Prometheus model. This combination gives you more relevant, timely and targeted results, with improved safety.
Applying AI to core search algorithm. We’ve also applied the AI model to our core Bing search ranking engine, which led to the largest jump in relevance in two decades. With this AI model, even basic search queries are more accurate and more relevant.
New user experience. We’re reimagining how you interact with search, browser and chat by pulling them into a unified experience. This will unlock a completely new way to interact with the web.

These groundbreaking new search experiences are possible because Microsoft has committed to building Azure into an AI supercomputer for the world, and OpenAI has used this infrastructure to train the breakthrough models that are now being optimized for Bing.

Microsoft and OpenAI – innovating together, responsibly

Together with OpenAI, we’ve also been intentional in implementing safeguards to defend against harmful content. Our teams are working to address issues such as misinformation and disinformation, content blocking, data safety and preventing the promotion of harmful or discriminatory content in line with our AI principles.

The work we are doing with OpenAI builds on our company’s yearslong effort to ensure that our AI systems are responsible by design. We will continue to apply the full strength of our responsible AI ecosystem – including researchers, engineers and policy experts – to develop new approaches to mitigate risk.

Live today in limited preview, expanding to millions soon

The new Bing is available today in a limited preview on desktop, and everyone can visit Bing.com today to try sample queries and sign up for the waitlist. We’re going to scale the preview to millions in the coming weeks. A mobile experience will also be in preview soon.

We’re excited to put the new Bing and Edge into the real world to get the critical feedback required to improve our models as we scale.

"Create more integrated cloud experiences with over 1,400 connectors","
		Last year, I had the opportunity to speak with customers across a wide range of sectors about how they are approaching the current economic climate. Whether they are focusing on increasing efficiency or driving cost savings, we are all essentially trying to do more with less and prioritize investments that will drive the most important and meaningful outcomes. Unfortunately, these resource constraints are coming at a time when data sources and data volumes continue to rise at staggering rates. According to a study published by the IDC, the amount of new data created, captured, replicated and consumed is expected to double in size by 2026. [1] This surge in data means IT departments are trying to adapt from terabyte-scale data management to now petabyte-scale — and doing so with even fewer resources.
Beyond this immense growth in data, organizations are also constantly adding new cloud solutions, applications and experiences to support their hybrid workforce and changing business needs. As the number of solutions grows, employees need connected experiences that enable them to bring their work from one tool to the next seamlessly. Unfortunately, the outcome is often the opposite as new solutions fail to integrate with the existing technology ecosystem, leading to siloed experiences and greater inefficiency.
Without security and governance solutions built to work across multi-cloud and app environments, this rise in apps and data also expands attack surfaces and opens gaps for adversaries to exploit and infiltrate. These attacks result in devastating business disruptions and financial damages with the average breach costing $4.35 million.[2]  Developing a cybersecurity strategy that can account for all potential attack surfaces is more complex than ever with 86% of surveyed decision-makers believing their current cybersecurity strategy does not keep up with their multi-cloud environments. [3]
All of these potential issues, from data replication to siloed experiences to growing attack surfaces, stem from disconnected data and applications across multi-cloud and multi-system environments. That’s why, across our Microsoft Cloud offerings, we’ve worked with our thriving Independent Software Vendor (ISV) ecosystem to create a library of over 1,400 connectors that allow you to seamlessly connect your third-party services to Microsoft Cloud solutions like Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft Power Query, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Graph and Microsoft Sentinel. The Microsoft Cloud is now not only the most trusted and comprehensive cloud, but it’s also one of the most connected and open clouds on the market with a connector library that continues to grow every day. These pre-existing integrations can help you:

Connect to and unlock value from all your data across your on-premises, multi-cloud, and third-party sources.
Combine Microsoft and third-party apps to create deeply integrated app experiences that support your unique business scenarios.
Safeguard your entire organization and eliminate gaps by ensuring your security, governance, and compliance solutions work across platforms and cloud environments.

No matter where your data currently resides or how you choose to manage it going forward, you can gain peace of mind knowing your Microsoft Cloud investments can connect to all your data and turn it into impact. That was one of the reasons Walmart chose to standardize on Microsoft Power BI for their reporting and analytics needs. “One of the key criteria in selecting our solution was knowing that Power BI works so well with a vast number of partners — not necessarily just Microsoft products,” says Micah Dail, Director, Finance Data & Analytics at Walmart.  “At Walmart, we use a myriad of different vendors in our technology stack, so having a tool like Power BI that can bring everything together was critical.”
Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital (ETZ), a leading clinical and education hospital and trauma center in the Netherlands, used pre-built Teams connectors to create powerful, integrated app experiences that help their clinicians get more done. With the Microsoft Teams Electronic Health Records (EHR) connector for Epic, ETZ clinicians can create and even join Microsoft Teams-supported appointments directly from the Epic EHR system, use interpreter services and other accessibility features, gather metadata about the appointment, view consumption reports, and much more. “We used Teams to help build a fully integrated solution so that clinicians can document virtual patient consultations without having to start up other systems,” says Ceasar van Eeden, Application Analyst at Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital. By using connectors to combine Microsoft and third-party tools, ETZ created an intelligent solution that best suited their unique business needs.

Coca-Cola UNITED, one of the largest and fastest growing bottlers and distributors of Coca-Cola products, saw multiple opportunities to automate and streamline processes using a low-code platform. To get the most out of this investment, they required a solution that could connect to and integrate with their existing SAP system which is hosted on Microsoft Azure. Beyond the simplicity of the platform, the extensive library of pre-built integrations with SAP and Azure services made the Microsoft Power Platform the ideal choice. “Once I learned about the data connectors and how they would work with our SQL database and our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, everything else just fell into place,” says Jared Simmons, Systems Analyst at Coca-Cola UNITED, “We also value the extensibility of the platform, enabling us to build and integrate custom connectors using Azure Logic Apps.” These custom connectors allowed Coca-Cola UNITED to create unique solutions integrated directly in their SAP system.
This huge library of connectors also helps ensure Microsoft’s industry-leading security, governance, and compliance solutions can easily work across platforms and cloud environments, leaving no gaps in protection. Take the global exam provider, Pearson VUE, for example. Pearson VUE needs to keep exam content completely confidential to maintain trust with its customers and protect test-takers. As the cybersecurity landscape gets increasingly challenging, they have adopted a host of Microsoft security solutions to help them stay protected. “We use Microsoft Sentinel to see everything that’s going on in our estate — whether from Microsoft or non-Microsoft security solutions — and be as proactive as possible,” says Vladan Pulec, Enterprise Architect at Pearson VUE. “The easy interoperability among Microsoft Sentinel and so many other solutions make it easier for us to standardize procedures and achieve greater cybersecurity.”

Since 2016, Microsoft has committed to building Azure into an AI supercomputer for the world, serving as the foundation of our vision to democratize AI as a platform. Through our initial investment and collaboration, Microsoft and OpenAI pushed the frontier of cloud supercomputing technology, announcing our first top-5 supercomputer in 2020, and subsequently constructing multiple AI supercomputing systems at massive scale. OpenAI has used this infrastructure to train its breakthrough models, which are now deployed in Azure to power category-defining AI products like GitHub Copilot, DALL·E 2 and ChatGPT.

These innovations have captured imaginations and introduced large-scale AI as a powerful, general-purpose technology platform that we believe will create transformative impact at the magnitude of the personal computer, the internet, mobile devices and the cloud.

Underpinning all of our efforts is Microsoft and OpenAI’s shared commitment to building AI systems and products that are trustworthy and safe. OpenAI’s leading research on AI Alignment and Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard not only establish a leading and advancing framework for the safe deployment of our own AI technologies, but will also help guide the industry toward more responsible outcomes.

Subject: Focusing on our short- and long-term opportunity,"Satya Nadella shared the below communication today with Microsoft employees.

We’re living through times of significant change, and as I meet with customers and partners, a few things are clear. First, as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we’re now seeing them optimize their digital spend to do more with less. We’re also seeing organizations in every industry and geography exercise caution as some parts of the world are in a recession and other parts are anticipating one. At the same time, the next major wave of computing is being born with advances in AI, as we’re turning the world’s most advanced models into a new computing platform.

This is the context in which we as a company must strive to deliver results on an ongoing basis, while investing in our long-term opportunity. I’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive, but it requires us to take actions grounded in three priorities.

First, we will align our cost structure with our revenue and where we see customer demand. Today, we are making changes that will result in the reduction of our overall workforce by 10,000 jobs through the end of FY23 Q3. This represents less than 5 percent of our total employee base, with some notifications happening today. It’s important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. We know this is a challenging time for each person impacted. The senior leadership team and I are committed that as we go through this process, we will do so in the most thoughtful and transparent way possible.

Second, we will continue to invest in strategic areas for our future, meaning we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness for the company, while divesting in other areas. These are the kinds of hard choices we have made throughout our 47-year history to remain a consequential company in this industry that is unforgiving to anyone who doesn’t adapt to platform shifts. As such, we are taking a $1.2 billion charge in Q2 related to severance costs, changes to our hardware portfolio, and the cost of lease consolidation as we create higher density across our workspaces.

And third, we will treat our people with dignity and respect, and act transparently. These decisions are difficult, but necessary. They are especially difficult because they impact people and people’s lives – our colleagues and friends. We are committed to ensuring all those whose roles are eliminated have our full support during these transitions. U.S.-benefit-eligible employees will receive a variety of benefits, including above-market severance pay, continuing healthcare coverage for six months, continued vesting of stock awards for six months, career transition services, and 60 days’ notice prior to termination, regardless of whether such notice is legally required. Benefits for employees outside the U.S. will align with the employment laws in each country.

When I think about this moment in time, the start of 2023, it’s showtime – for our industry and for Microsoft. As a company, our success must be aligned to the world’s success. That means every one of us and every team across the company must raise the bar and perform better than the competition to deliver meaningful innovation that customers, communities, and countries can truly benefit from. If we deliver on this, we will emerge stronger and thrive long into the future; it’s as simple as that.

I want to extend my deepest thanks and gratitude to everyone who has contributed to Microsoft up to this point and to all of you who will continue to contribute as we chart our path ahead. Thank you for the focus, dedication, and resilience you demonstrate for Microsoft and our customers and partners each day.

Satya"

M12 ventures down a new path,"Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella with Manny Medina, cofounder and CEO of Outreach, one of M12’s portfolio companies.

As we begin a new year, I am delighted to share some exciting changes we’ve made at M12 to better deliver value to our portfolio companies and to Microsoft. While I experimented with ChatGPT while writing this blog post, and have been impressed by its results, I decided on a traditional, human approach.

2022 was quite the year overall, with some exceptional volatility in the startup and venture capital ecosystem. We whipsawed from valuing speed of execution and growth above efficiency, to prizing diligence with guidance toward efficiency and profitability as valuations returned to pre-pandemic levels.

In the six years since M12 was founded, we’re proud to have invested in over 100 companies, including 15 unicorns and 6 IPOs. Millions of people rely on the products and services from M12 portfolio companies to protect them from identity fraud, ensure healthcare facilities have accurate patient data, engage in learning to help them do their jobs better and make their tasks easier though AI experiences. We are at our best when we partner early with teams and will continue to focus on investing in Series A and B startups.

However, over the last 12 months, we realized startups and Microsoft needed a new M12, and so we developed a more focused investment strategy tightly aligned to Microsoft. This has helped us create exceptional value through connections, customers and unique benefits for our portfolio. You might say we’ve leaned into the “M” of M12, where we tap more into Microsoft and the power of its network.

Our closer connection to Microsoft focuses our work and positions our portfolio companies to accelerate their growth, two things that are proving to be even more critical as we navigate the volatile macroeconomy. This approach is part of our new mission, and we’ve added additional experienced investors and operators to our team to make it a reality.

As we continue our work to build and nurture innovative early-stage startups, our goal is for our companies to have meaningful partnerships with us that empower them to win.

We’re thesis-driven and aligned to Microsoft stakeholders to support portfolio growth

Our core thesis areas are AI, cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, developer tools and vertical SaaS (areas like retail and healthcare). Great companies in these spaces such as Innovaccer, a healthcare data platform, and At-Bay, a cyber insurance platform, often find success partnering with Microsoft on product integrations, growing their customer base, building out ecosystems and getting traction in our sales motions.

We also selectively make frontier investments in companies that innovate in autonomous systems and Web3, metaverse and gaming. These are spaces we think have the potential to influence the future direction of the industry, and we work to ensure they too can realize the power of having a deeper connection to Microsoft.

For example, Web3 is an emergent category we are paying close attention to and are partnering with Microsoft to support companies that are innovating here.

Space and Time, one of our latest investments in this area, is a decentralized database company. Their plans include an integration with Microsoft Azure to help customers access, manage and run analytics on blockchain-native data, a key driver of their growth goals. In this new era of ubiquitous computing, the comprehensive Microsoft Azure cloud platform and industry-leading identity and security capabilities provide a trusted set of services to develop and run Web3 applications, enabling Space and Time to build new and advanced use cases in Web3.

In addition to our work with Space and Time, we’ve seen our thesis-driven approach help create more value across the M12 portfolio.

Our new approach to stakeholder engagement and thesis-driven investment saw its biggest moment in recent months with our announcement of the M12 GitHub Fund. GitHub, which is part of the Microsoft family of companies, is all about empowering developers. With DevOps being one of our core thesis areas, our partnership created a fund managed by M12 to make investments in promising open source startups developing on GitHub’s platform. CodeSee, an open source platform that enables developer teams to visually understand their codebases, and Novu, open source notification infrastructure for developers, are our first portfolio companies to benefit from this effort. We see the establishment of this fund as a powerful proof point that Microsoft, M12 and our portfolio are all better together.

Leaning into the power of our platform to deliver value 

To deliver on the goal of bringing differentiated value to startups, we’ve leveraged our redesigned investment approach to better support our portfolio. Our investing and operating team members are now aligned to our specific thesis areas, which allows us to develop deeper expertise and partnerships in these domains.

Before every investment, we challenge ourselves to identify the unique value we can add. To meet that commitment, today more than half our team is dedicated to helping our portfolio companies realize their growth objectives. This support may take the form of a startup showcase with Microsoft’s CEO and most senior leaders; introducing our portfolio companies to new customers; a senior Microsoft executive formally advising a portfolio company; facilitating technology collaborations or engaging in co-selling or marketing activities. No matter the case, we’re always working to find creative solutions to deliver value for our portfolio companies.

Aqua Security has a strong history of working with Microsoft to include deep product collaborations, and co-selling and joint marketing activities to accelerate Azure deployments. In one example of this relationship, Aqua enables software licensing and procurement directly through the Microsoft Azure Marketplace, allowing customers to utilize existing purchasing methods in place for Azure services. This solution simplifies the process of building out a secure infrastructure for cloud applications, and customers deploying containers on Azure can utilize the solution to quickly complete their purchasing cycle.

Aqua and Microsoft have jointly conducted a series of regional marketing programs to educate customers on cloud native technologies and provided the opportunity to interact with local technical resources from both companies. As Aqua’s enterprise customer base and scale of their cloud deployments increase, Microsoft’s prime position as a cloud leader is a distinctive benefit to their success.

This type of collaboration and many others like it make us confident we can be a driver of innovation and an enabler of growth. By investing in areas where we have a unique ability to support our portfolio companies, we see a bright future for our work ahead and the technology that our fund will enable. We’re excited by what our approach can do for entrepreneurs, and we can’t wait to see what’s in store for 2023 and beyond.

Feel free to reach out to us or learn more about our team at m12.vc. We’re always looking to connect with interesting companies and partners to help accelerate the future of technology.

The future of mobility is now: Five themes to watch at CES 2023,"Vehicles are becoming increasingly smarter, more connected, and software defined.

It’s hard to believe a mere 200 years ago, the horse and carriage were the predominant mode of transportation — and had been for hundreds of years. And then, with the invention of the internal combustion engine, moving people and goods changed immensely in a short period of time. Mobility became more accessible, affordable and created opportunities far beyond the scope of imagination.

It was that once-in-a-century change that brought us to where we are today.

Now, we’re facing another once-in-a-century transformation.

The mobility industry is at a critical inflection point. Major innovation is underway: Vehicles are becoming smarter, more connected, and software-defined — and in some cases, autonomous. Electrification is taking hold. A focus on sustainability is rising to the forefront. Innovators in our industry are reimagining every aspect of moving people and goods around the world, and Microsoft is proud to partner with those who are reinventing mobility.

And yet, this metamorphosis is challenged by global macroeconomic challenges, supply chain disruptions, energy shortages and lagging worker availability. It’s never been more important to do more with less.

As we kick off CES 2023 in Las Vegas, we’re bound to see emphasis on both sides of this paradigm shift — innovations that improve mobility while at the same time increasing efficiencies, providing opportunities to reduce our environmental footprint, and connecting people in new ways. As a key partner to the industry, Microsoft has a unique viewpoint into its evolution — we don’t produce vehicles, monetize our customers’ data, or compete with their brands. Instead, we help empower automakers and mobility service providers with intelligent cloud and edge technologies to help them build their own unique digital platforms to push the boundaries of what’s possible.

Microsoft accelerates the transformation of automotive, mobility and transportation companies into data- and software-driven mobility services providers. Azure cloud-based analytics services unlock unique insights collected across customer interactions, data sources, workforce and operations performance, and our extensive cloud services and partner ecosystem enables new revenue streams from differentiated mobility services.

This year’s CES — which kicks off tomorrow — features a dedicated transportation hall, giving us an opportunity to dive in and explore the future of mobility. Here are key themes to watch as organizations bring their latest and greatest to the most influential tech event in the world.

Across industries, a resilient supply chain is top of mind.

1. Creating sustainable, collaborative supply chains that improve resilience.

While resiliency is a key ingredient of long-term organizational viability, it’s taken on a new meaning in the current climate. Just about every industry has felt the cascading impacts of supply chain disruptions, and mitigating those disruptions is crucial to restoring expectations.

In the trucking industry, timing is everything. Ensuring that trucks get to customers on time requires identifying problems early and being able to respond nimbly. But a lack of visibility across the supply chain makes it difficult to know when there are issues that could impact production and, consequently, delivery. To help streamline the processes and keep an end-to-end eye on its entire supply chain, Daimler Truck North America is using the Microsoft Supply Chain Platform to improve visibility, reduce downtime and increase efficiencies.

And when it comes to vehicles, visibility into the supply chain is essential to production. With the new MO360 Data Platform, Mercedes-Benz is connecting its about 30 passenger car plants worldwide to the Microsoft Cloud, enhancing transparency and predictability across its digital production and supply chain. The MO360 Data Platform is the evolution of Mercedes-Benz’ digital production ecosystem MO360 and allows teams to identify potential supply chain bottlenecks faster and enable a dynamic prioritization of production resources.

Empowering frontline workers is critical to agility. ZF has deployed Power Platform to enable employees to collaborate with professional developers.

2. Using AI and connected data to create agile business processes.

AI and data are helping fundamentally reimagine critical business practices and play a key role in streamlining cumbersome, outdated processes. When utilized responsibly, AI and machine learning can have a positive impact on daily life — and many in the industry are taking advantage of opportunities to improve experiences for both employees and customers, while impacting sustainability as well.

Travel and tourism is approaching — and even surpassing — pre-pandemic levels, and American Airlines is preparing for this influx by using technology in new ways to make its business more efficient and the travel experience more seamless for its customers. By building its platform on Microsoft Azure and applying AI, machine learning and data analytics to its systems, it’s been able to reduce time waiting on the runway, saving thousands of gallons of jet fuel per year, and give connecting customers extra time to make their next flights.

With 180+ production locations around the world, empowering frontline workers isn’t a nice to have — it’s a must have for ZF. A global technology company that supplies materials for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and industrial technology, the company has empowered employees to use low-code solutions on Microsoft Power Platform to collaborate with its professional developers. In one example, ZF employees helped improve lean manufacturing audits by developing a solution that eradicated use of spreadsheets and migrated data into robust Power BI reports — and created significant time and resources savings.

Lynk & Co has Microsoft Teams built into the infotainment system of its 01 model.

3. Delivering personalized in-car and customer experiences.

Differentiation is critical when options abound. Brands that invest in knowing their customers and providing specialized experiences throughout the customer lifecycle will excel, and we’re going to see a new emphasis on personalization in the automotive space. No longer are buyers “stuck” with the static experience delivered upon vehicle purchase. In-car personalization through connected and software-defined vehicles unlocks the ability to provide ongoing updates to the vehicle experience.

Just this week, General Motors announced it’s partnering with Microsoft to deploy new software-defined vehicle services. As GM’s Ultifi platform nears deployment in 2023, GM will use Microsoft Azure cloud and AI services to help simplify its software development and bring convenient and secure digital mobility services to millions of customers faster.

And in productivity, Lynk & Co has developed a unique, built-in meetings app within the infotainment system of its 01 model vehicle, working alongside Microsoft. The app enables users to join Teams meetings on the go, bringing a new dimension of the in-car experience and adding versatility to mobility.

Software-driven vehicles are evolving quickly.

4. Embracing innovation with software-driven and autonomous vehicles.

Innovation in the software-defined and autonomous vehicle space is happening at a very fast pace, and we mustn’t overlook the importance of coming together to reduce complexity and encourage collaboration. Together, we can go farther, faster.

We believe an open-source environment is critical to long-term success, and the work that the Eclipse Foundation is driving is key to delivering this. Microsoft intends to improve developer efficiencies by providing a layer of abstraction that simplifies management of the underlying in-vehicle architecture and lower-level capabilities, and we’ve contributed two projects that focus on modern Application Programming Model and Digital Twins to the foundation’s work. These two interrelated projects aim to significantly reduce the complexity involved in developing in-vehicle applications and enable a large developer community.

We continue to support the development of assisted and autonomous driving and are excited with the partnership with many players in the industry including Wavye, Cruise and others.

This week, Supernal, Hyundai Motor Group’s Advanced Air Mobility company, announced a collaboration with us to advance autonomy, digital operations and cloud integration technologies for the aviation industry by running on the Microsoft Cloud platform. With Microsoft Azure, Supernal can leverage the flexibility and cloud computing power needed to run secure simulations at scale and accelerate its time to commercialization.

The industrial metaverse empowers OEMs to streamline training and improve service regardless of geographic location.

5. Designing new experiences in the metaverse that inspire, connect and empower.

“Metaverse” is perhaps the buzzword of the industry, with much excitement building about what’s possible in this new dimension. We’re seeing several applications that are particularly effective in the industry, on both the industrial and consumer-facing sides.

In particular, the industrial metaverse offers opportunities for improved training scenarios, with experts and those connecting with them able to be geographically dispersed.

With HoloLens 2 and Dynamics 365 Guides, automakers like Toyota Motor North America, Nissan Motor Corporation and others, train employees without having experts physically in the same location, without stacks of paper manuals, and in a way that makes it possible for employees to learn while doing. This approach can reduce the time required to learn new processes and skills, and the content can be created without special programming or IT skills.

And we’re seeing our customers embrace streamlining and improving consumer-facing experiences as well. Recently, FIAT announced a fully virtual showroom for its new FIAT 500 hosted in the metaverse and running on Microsoft Azure, where customers in Italy can interact with product specialists to discover the vehicle, simulate a test drive on the famous La Pista 500, and make a new vehicle purchase — from the comfort of their couches. Developed with Microsoft and Touchcast, you can experience this virtual showroom now.

These are just a few of the trends we expect to continue into the coming year. While none of us know exactly what’s to come, one thing’s for sure — the industry is evolving faster than ever before — and we are excited to help empower a safe, sustainable and productive future of mobility.

Microsoft names new Chief Sustainability Officer,"I’m delighted to share the news that Melanie Nakagawa will join Microsoft in January as our new Chief Sustainability Officer. Reporting directly to me as a Corporate Vice President, Melanie will partner with teams across Microsoft and take on the leadership role for our company-wide environmental sustainability work.

Melanie brings to Microsoft almost two decades of environmental sustainability experience at the nexus of policy, business and technology, which will be vital as we continue our sustainability journey. She most recently served as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Climate and Energy on the National Security Council at the White House, one of several roles she has held in the U.S. government. At the White House, Melanie played a leadership role on international and domestic climate initiatives, as well as energy issues that included the international energy response to the war in Ukraine.

Melanie Nakagawa

This built on Melanie’s prior work, including as the director of climate strategy for a climate tech-focused private equity firm working with growth stage companies in North America, Europe and Asia. She also brings experience in the nonprofit and academic sectors on environmental and energy policy and regulatory issues.

Melanie joins Microsoft at a critical time. January will mark the third anniversary of our ambitious climate goals to be carbon negative by 2030 and remove our historical carbon emissions by 2050. While I’m pleased with our progress, we must accelerate our momentum and broaden even further our climate-related work.

This urgency reflects the current state of climate issues around the world. As I found while meeting with global leaders last month at the United Nations COP27 climate conference in Egypt, the world confronts a complex and sobering challenge. As the United Nations Environment Programme reported in October in its annual Emissions Gap report, current national climate plans fall short of what will be needed to meet the world’s climate targets.

And as U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said at COP27, the “deadly impacts of climate change are here and now.” This means the world must not only push harder toward the goal of a Net Zero economy by the middle of the century, but move quickly and aggressively, especially in the Global South, to help vulnerable populations adapt to a world with a changed climate.

Given the enormity of these challenges, the pursuit of progress will require extraordinary innovation in the years and decades ahead.

And while every month seems to bring new foreboding studies, I also found cause for optimism in Egypt. For example, globally almost 4,000 companies have now dedicated themselves to the pursuit of climate pledges. And as the world focuses on the implementation of climate pledges – a major theme at COP27 – businesses have an increasingly important role to play. This was on bold display at COP27 as the United States’ Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, announced that the First Movers Coalition, launched just last year with the World Economic Forum, had grown to 65 companies dedicated to working and moving together faster.

Especially for a company like Microsoft, with our focus on helping the world’s organizations innovate through technology, our climate-related role could not be clearer. Cloud-based digital services, the better use of data, and rapid advances in AI will create new opportunities for us to help every organization achieve more progress in addressing the world’s climate and energy needs.

This connects directly with the three-fold sustainability mission that we launched as a company in September at the U.N. General Assembly meetings and that Melanie will now lead.

First, we will continue to drive toward achieving by 2030 our commitments to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste as a company while contributing to the biodiversity of the planet. The team that Melanie leads includes environmental scientists of international stature, and they will help keep Microsoft’s work grounded in the best available science. And more than ever, the Environmental Sustainability operations team will partner with Microsoft’s Finance team and business and sustainability experts across the company to achieve the company’s internal and operational goals.

All this will build on recent and important steps across Microsoft. These include the construction of a new Thermal Energy Center for our Redmond campus, the pursuit of a Net Zero water certification for our Silicon Valley campus, and our most recent steps toward Zero Waste operations through the opening of our 4th and 5th Circular Centers in Singapore and Chicago. These complement our global renewable energy investments for our datacenters and investments that have made Microsoft the largest carbon removal purchaser in the world.

Second, we will accelerate innovation and deliver technology to help our customers and partners achieve their sustainability goals. Like Lucas Joppa, our first Chief Environmental Officer, Melanie will work with me to bring together leaders across Microsoft to work together and learn from each other. The good news is that sustainability has become an important team sport across Microsoft, with senior leaders in place for product development, marketing and sales, including Microsoft’s Elisabeth Brinton and Darryl Willis, who work hand in hand with our customers and partners to transform their businesses with our sustainability and energy solutions. Each quarter we’re strengthening the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, adding capabilities and investing in the next-generation, cloud-based sustainability data ecosystem the world needs. All this connects closely with the broader array of innovations in the Microsoft Cloud and our own climate and renewable energy innovations across one of the world’s largest arrays of datacenter operations.

Third, we will partner with governments, nonprofits, and businesses to spur the broader societal enabling factors critical to global sustainability progress. This includes existing and new initiatives that Melanie and her team will lead to help:

Broaden the use of climate-related data and more powerful AI, including by the United Nations and across the Global South;
Advance new and innovative climate, energy, and sustainability laws, policies and regulations;
Support reliable, interoperable, and globally aligned measurement accounting and reporting systems for carbon emissions;
Build new markets for climate and sustainability solutions, including through our Climate Innovation Fund and carbon removal purchases; and
Help develop and support the skills and talent needed for both specialized sustainability roles, as well as for existing jobs that will evolve to require sustainability fluency.

These three sustainability missions are grounded in three tenets that will guide our future sustainability work as a company.

First, we believe there is a virtuous cycle connecting these three missions. Progress in each mission helps strengthen our ability to pursue the next. In this sense, all three are interrelated and dependent on each other.

Second, we believe that cross-sector efforts will be indispensable for sustainability progress. As with almost all big problems in the world, we need a three-legged stool: business, nonprofits and governments. We believe that businesses have a unique role to play in innovation, especially when it comes to climate, energy and digital technology and product innovation. Nonprofits are often the best at incubating new societal solutions, often by using innovations that come from the business sector. And governments can bring solutions to scale in a way that no one else can, both through their public budgets and the power to legislate and regulate. Even in a divided world, the planet’s sustainability challenges require that we all come together.

Finally, across Microsoft (and the world, for that matter), environmental sustainability is becoming infused in almost everything we do, and our success requires navigating a matrix rather than managing a system of command and control. Melanie and the Environmental Sustainability team she will lead acts as a fulcrum across Microsoft, helping to bring everyone together and speaking publicly for the company. This is like the role that our corporate teams play in a variety of other areas, including accessibility, digital safety, privacy, human rights and responsible AI. As we’ve learned, the difference between success and failure always turns on our ability to work effectively as a team across a large company and with an even larger digital ecosystem.

It’s typically my role and privilege to help empower, work with and support talented leaders across all these areas and more. None of the issues are easy. And the environmental sustainability challenges may even be harder than most.

I’m excited that Melanie Nakagawa will help lead so many talented people across our company as we address the planet’s sustainability needs. And I look forward to supporting her!

App Innovation Report: Prioritizing human pain points to build high-impact experiences,"In October, our Microsoft Ignite event drove incredible dialogue around how organizations can navigate a challenging market. Digital perseverance as encapsulated so well by Judson Althoff, our executive vice president, and chief commercial officer, resonates deeply with us across the Azure business and is sharpening how we think of strategic innovation in the face of headwinds.

There’s that word: Innovation. It continues to mean so many things to so many and, honestly, innovation becomes harder to distill amid constrained resources and near-term pressure. As we close 2022, reflecting on our own transformation, we remain inspired by a holistic cloud strategy; one which balances what’s coming around the corner with what lies ahead. Now more than ever, continuing to innovate in the right places is essential to maintaining a productivity edge internally, and strengthening differentiation externally. Your app estate is on the front lines of it all.

Last week, we shared insights from a range of cloud customers who plan to concentrate on migration and modernization plans for business resilience. Now I want to hone in on what kinds of modern experiences are in high demand to help organizations prioritize. Today, we’re releasing our first App Innovation Report, which identifies where digital investments can root innovation in human pain points. It all comes back to what problems need solving and looking at return on investment from another critical angle: the people who technology serves. As different as we are and as complex as our digital world has become, we psychologically seek a lot of the same things. We each value flow, integration, simplicity, efficiency, protection, freedom and fulfillment. By tapping into these common threads, businesses can deliver experiences people enjoy and keep coming back to.

Foundational security and integration concerns rise to the top

This fall we studied over 1,500 people working on the front lines of business challenges in healthcare, manufacturing and retail, and while we spoke to them as employees, we considered their perspectives as patients and shoppers too; the business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C) duality to our application expectations is pretty fascinating. Through interviews and surveys in five innovation hubs — the United States, Norway, Brazil, Japan and India — we applied social science to the state of the digital experience. It felt good to take a step back and ask our customers’ customers one simple question: What do you want and need from apps today? The answers surprised us — not because they were grandiose or futuristic but because they were foundational.

Top 16 forces of app innovation: “Promise scores” above reflect a combination of people’s rational preference and emotional passion. Scores are indexed against an average of 100, so scores above 100 represent the most promising innovation areas.

People feel stuck, frustrated and lost because of disjointed apps

People around the world in a vast range of roles expressed the most passion about disruption to their workflow. On the receiving side of apps of all kinds, there’s palpable frustration from having to manually patch together disparate tasks and tools. We learned people are struggling to secure data automatically, to streamline repetitive input, and to have well-informed interactions with others. While we heard desire for immersive technologies bubbling to the forefront, it wasn’t as prominent as pragmatic everyday realities and, from an Azure lens these areas signal opportunities to help advance AI automation, API management and app intelligence. Whether you’re migrating workloads, modernizing or building something new for flexibility and scale, the cloud can architecturally address so many of the trends we found.

Fear of compromising company data weighs on workers too

In the industries we researched, people share their companies’ concerns about data breaches on a personal, day-to-day level. In healthcare, they spoke about pressures surrounding HIPAA requirements when handling patient data. A sense of nervousness about security was also expressed in manufacturing, a highly targeted industry for ransomware, and retail workers worry about their accountability in handling customers’ financial information. Security is so incredibly important to us in Azure, so hearing from the usage and functionality side of this space emboldens us to partner on app development that can continue to advance confidence up and down organizations.

The cloud investments we make and the customization we code affect so many layers of a company and, in the applications space, innovation boils down to experiences people can count on and even enjoy using — it’s one of the most fulfilling aspects of the business we’re in. Well-architected workloads don’t only enable cost optimization, they provide a foundation of innovation where business leaders, technology and developer teams can adapt quickly to deliver secure, intelligent and intuitive apps people keep coming back to.

The need for more meaningful conversations stands out in retail

In light of the season, one industry-specific breakdown is especially timely. We see experience needs rank differently in retail compared to other cross-industry averages, with repetitive input surpassing automatic security, and desire for meaningful conversations breaking through in a way we don’t see elsewhere. Because shoppers today do so much research before visiting stores, retail workers want digital solutions that can help them provide information about product features, pricing, discounts and availability without breaking their connection to the customer. A sales engagement that feels jarring or closed off today could become warmer and interactive tomorrow.

Retail-specific needs: “Promise scores” from retail workers above are also indexed against an average of 100. Scores as high as 141 and 133 indicate exceptionally strong rational preference and emotional passion.

Business leaders agree with worker concerns but need help prioritizing

Rounding out the research, we put our report in front of business leaders — those who choose Azure services and customers of other cloud providers. We also wanted to understand how chief technology, digital and operations officers are thinking about app design, and the themes voiced by workers were equally important to them. So, if workers have unmet needs like this and leadership is aligned, what’s next? Prioritization.

How we each define innovation is as unique as the cloud journeys we’re on but giving app experiences more shape helps us see strategic pockets in new ways and grounds cloud investments in the people who run your business, in the people you’re selling to. What kinds of inefficiencies are draining resources most immediately? Which growth territories will you target to compete? Organizations can’t tackle every app innovation project at once, but together, we can carve out data-driven spots that present the most promise.

Spot the opportunities: People’s rational preference and emotional passion for different app innovation areas are mapped above in the context of satisfaction with existing solutions in the market and relevance in their lives. Clockwise from the top-right quadrant, the urgency of each innovation area is broken out for planning.

One of the many things that drew me to Azure’s business is how many people it touches. When we look at Azure customers like the NBA, H&M or Starbucks, we see how very tangible outcomes are in the palm of our own hands as consumers and suddenly, what the cloud makes possible begins to click no matter who you’re talking to. When I watch real-time data on my Boston Celtics, when I’m able to shop for loved ones in a single click, and I can enjoy an iconic red cup without waiting in line, I am experiencing cloud-first app investments that pay off in spades. From the back end to the front end of app design, we’re reminded that business impact of everything digital is highly human.

On behalf of the Azure team, we hope the App Innovation Report inspires your work going into the new year. And no matter how or what you celebrate, I wish you and your loved ones a safe and happy season.

		Microsoft looks to generate $5 billion in revenue from LSEG and the financial services sector through 10-year strategic partnership.
Today, we announced a 10-year strategic partnership with the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), a world-leading financial markets infrastructure and data provider. Following LSEG’s acquisition of Refinitiv, a market leader in data services, LSEG has differentiated itself in the market with an end-to-end proposition across trading, execution, data and analytics solutions. Together we look forward to empowering the future of financial markets by delivering next generation data, analytics and workspace solutions that transform how firms connect, research, analyze, collaborate and transact across the entire financial markets value chain.

Organizations across the capital markets value chain are facing an increasingly complex operating environment with macroeconomic headwinds, stricter regulatory controls and traditional revenue sources becoming more challenging. These conditions are putting greater pressure on firms to reinvent business models and do more with less. However, their legacy platforms, siloed information, limits on scale and data overload hinder their ability to deliver the best client experience, insights and tools. This requires a digital transformation approach underpinned by modern cloud and AI technology. LSEG has already started to address these issues for their customers, and through this strategic partnership, we will accelerate that transformation.
Additionally, capital markets run on data and by investing in the co-creation of new solutions, we will capitalize on the incremental opportunity we have together and support clients in their transformation.
“This strategic partnership is a significant milestone on LSEG’s journey towards becoming the leading global financial markets infrastructure and data business and will transform the experience for our customers,” said David Schwimmer, CEO of London Stock Exchange Group.
Democratizing financial markets data
Foundational to the partnership will be the digital transformation of LSEG’s technology infrastructure and data and analytics platforms onto the Microsoft Cloud. This will include Refinitiv platforms that power over 40,000 financial institutions in 190 countries with data, analytics and insights across millions of active time series databases, daily evaluations, exchange trades and derivatives, equity quotes and significant research on public and private companies.
With this foundation, we will co-create an open, centralized, financial data platform enabling seamless data democratization, collaboration and new monetization opportunities across the financial services ecosystem. This will unlock new offerings for customers to generate more sophisticated and timely insights.
Delivering next-generation workspace experiences
The financial markets community spends a large part of their day working across multiple terminals and platforms, disparate data sets and siloed analytical tools with limited collaboration capabilities. To enhance productivity and time to value, we will work together to co-create an open all-in-one data, analytics, workflow and collaboration solution that will reimagine client experiences for the first time.
This will be realized through the next generation of LSEG Workspace on Microsoft Teams platform that will support in-application rich experiences for understanding trends and analyzing risk and building scenarios while meeting strict security, privacy and compliance requirements.
Additionally, with enhanced Excel integration, customers will be able to create financial models, run data analytics and visualizations using LSEG content delivered in Excel and work seamlessly between LSEG Workspace and Microsoft 365.
The initial focus will be on delivering interoperability between LSEG Workspace and Microsoft Teams, Excel and PowerPoint with other Microsoft applications and a new version of LSEG’s Workspace, accessed entirely within the Microsoft 365 suite, to be added in the future.
Creating intelligent analytic solutions
Today, firms can experience duplicated costs and complexity in harnessing the full power of analytics to unlock models that garner intelligent insights for business decision making. To address this need, we will work together to co-create next generation analytics and modeling solutions which are cloud-based and will enable powerful model construction, validation, diagnostics and deployment using Microsoft Azure AI, Synapse, Power BI, Excel and Teams with LSEG’s advanced analytics and modeling capabilities.
It will empower investment bankers, traders, wealth and asset managers, as well as risk, compliance, strategy and advisory managers to run hyperscale analytics models against data efficiently and seamlessly. Built on top of Azure Synapse, Azure Machine Learning and Microsoft Purview, the new cloud-based analytics and modeling solutions will enable users to expose, share and collaborate across proprietary and third-party data securely and confidently, meeting stringent data privacy, security and compliance requirements, eliminating the need to move or copy the data to another location (which can be expensive, time-consuming and introduce security and compliance concerns).
Additionally, quantitative analysts, data scientists and engineers will be able to build custom models to drive their analysis and decision making seamlessly. Both can help organizations spend less time, money and effort building and maintaining their own infrastructure.
“Bringing together our leading data sets, analytics and global customer base with Microsoft’s comprehensive and trusted cloud services and global reach creates attractive revenue growth opportunities for both companies” said David Schwimmer, CEO of London Stock Exchange Group.
Additionally, we will explore the development of digital market infrastructure based on cloud technology, with a goal to transform how market participants interact with capital markets across a broad range of asset classes.
This partnership represents a significant milestone for the future of financial markets and builds on Microsoft’s investments across capital markets and more broadly across the financial services industry. Microsoft estimates this partnership, and broader market opportunity, could generate an additional $5 billion in revenue for the company over the next 10 years, including the $2.8 billion minimum spend commitments from LSEG for cloud services and support.
Microsoft will also purchase an approximately 4% equity stake in LSEG through the acquisition of shares from the Blackstone/Thomson Reuters Consortium.
“We are delighted to welcome Microsoft as a shareholder. We believe our partnership with Microsoft will transform the way our customers discover, analyze and trade securities around the world, and create substantial value over time. We look forward to delivering on that potential,” said David Schwimmer, CEO of London Stock Exchange Group.

Microsoft continues commitment to US Department of Defense with JWCC selection,"The recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) selecting Microsoft among the cloud service providers to support its Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract is a significant milestone in the department’s goal to establish an enterprise-level tactical cloud. With the announcement, Microsoft will help deliver mission-critical 21st century technology to our nation’s service members and strengthen U.S. national security. The selection is another clear demonstration of the trust the DoD places in Microsoft and our technologies.

Our work on JWCC will build on the success of our industry-leading cloud capabilities to support national security missions that we have developed and deployed across the department and service branches. We continue to develop new technologies that utilize the latest commercial innovations, enable interoperability and are designed to bring data analysis and insight to the tactical edge. Microsoft’s investment is also aligned with the department’s 2021 OCONUS cloud strategy, including building Azure Government Secret and Azure Government Top Secret classified clouds to provide the DoD with secure cloud capabilities at all classification levels. We’ve designed ruggedized edge devices to bring advanced compute capabilities to the most remote regions of the world. We expanded our Azure Space and 5G capabilities to ensure ubiquitous connectivity so that service members can process, analyze and operationalize data whenever and whenever they need it. This continuous innovation puts us ahead of the curve and in a strong position to meet all the key milestones for JWCC, along with key DoD priorities such as their AI and cloud strategies and Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiatives, in the coming months and years.

The solutions and services we’ve developed are built on a foundation of cybersecurity, deployed across all devices, clouds, apps and platforms. We’re supporting the DoD’s deployment of its Zero Trust strategy to further secure their network and systems, building on our existing efforts with programs like Navy’s Flank Speed to protect nearly half a million identities and devices. Microsoft brings together massive signal depth and diversity of over 43 trillion signals per day synthesized daily using sophisticated data analytics and AI algorithms, and a global team of 8,500-plus security experts to deliver unparalleled protection.

Collaboration across industry and academia is also key to accelerating innovation and advancing the DoD’s mission. That’s why we’ve set up deep partnerships to advance research and development in emerging areas. We recently announced a strategic partnership with Lockheed Martin to innovate with our classified cloud, enhance secure 5G connectivity at the edge, and improve gaming, exercising, modeling and simulation (GEMS) capabilities to bring military planning and coordination through immersive environments. Earlier this year, we announced a collaboration with the Naval Postgraduate School to advance cloud-enhanced intelligent edge networking and computing, modernize remote training and education, and develop solutions to operationalize emerging technologies in the field for the Navy and Marine Corps. And we’re helping defense partners, like Raytheon Technologies and Oshkosh, move to the cloud to help the broader industry align to the DoD’s priorities.

We believe the multi-cloud approach for JWCC is the right one for the DoD’s enterprise infrastructure. Multi-cloud is already an established best practice in the commercial industry because it enables organizations to maximize flexibility, enhance resiliency and access the best technologies across providers. With comprehensive infrastructure and data management solutions like Azure Arc, Microsoft Purview and Defender for Cloud, Microsoft will be a key partner to the DoD as they navigate the multi-cloud environment and ensure seamless interoperability of systems and services.

As we have demonstrated for more than 40 years, our focus on who we are serving will never waver. We remain committed to the department and to those serving around the world who are helping keep us all safe.

Building a more inclusive workplace: Microsoft releases action plan following independent review,"At Microsoft, we take our commitment to creating a safe, inclusive work environment for all employees very seriously. In keeping with this commitment, today we are announcing new steps to prevent discrimination and harassment, following a 2021 proposal that was approved by Microsoft’s shareholders.

Based on this proposal, Microsoft’s Board of Directors engaged the law firm of ArentFox Schiff LLP to conduct an independent review of the company’s sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies and practices. ArentFox has completed its work and has provided the Board with a report detailing its findings and recommendations. In addition, the Microsoft management team has prepared an implementation plan that addresses all the recommendations in the ArentFox report. In many cases, the recommendations build on and extend work already in progress. The Board has thoroughly reviewed the ArentFox report, and it has approved the specific actions in the implementation plan.

Today the company is publishing a full transparency report from ArentFox as well as a summary of management’s implementation plan. The transparency report can be viewed here. This 50-page report contains all the findings and recommendations made by ArentFox, with only limited confidential and privileged information omitted (as suggested by the terms of the shareholder resolution last year). Management’s implementation plan can be viewed here.

“Cultivating a culture where everyone is empowered to do meaningful work and can thrive is our greatest responsibility at Microsoft,” said Satya Nadella, Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “The Board of Directors has taken this investigation seriously and the resulting comprehensive report outlines important areas where we can continue to improve, as well as progress we’ve made. The Board of Directors and our senior leaders are fully committed to this implementation plan as we continually work to close the gap between our espoused culture and the lived experience of our employees.”

We believe that today’s plan will further strengthen Microsoft’s culture and build upon a broad array of existing policies, trainings, and complaint and investigative procedures. While we have taken meaningful steps in recent years to make improvements in all these areas, we recognize that this work requires a journey and not a single destination, with a commitment to continuous self-improvement.

We also remain committed to broad transparency. We therefore will continue to regularly update our employees and stakeholders on our progress and look forward to sharing the results of this work in the future.

Board Approved Implementation Plan:


Comprehensive Policy Review: The company will implement a broad review of key policies critical to culture and compliance to improve employee ease of access, discoverability and awareness, as well as revisit appropriate policy owners in an effort to improve employee education and experience. HR and Legal will implement this recommendation by June 30, 2023.

Targeted Policy Revisions: The company will revise the Anti-Harassment/Anti-Discrimination policy to incorporate recommended language designed to provide employees with greater clarity on workplace behavioral expectations and investigation process. Similarly, the Conflicts of Interest policy will be revised to provide greater clarity on the definition of familial and romantic relationships and set forth an internal process for disclosure of certain consensual relationships. HR and Legal will implement this recommendation by December 31, 2022.

Broaden Awareness of Legal Rights: The company will amplify existing internal communications about employees’ rights to seek external relief for concerns raised under the anti-harassment and discrimination policies. HR and Legal will implement this recommendation by December 31, 2022.

Reinforcing Policies with Expanded Training: The company will enhance and expand existing training of new senior leaders and executives. HR and Legal will implement this recommendation by March 31, 2023.

Reconsideration Process: Currently, the company reviews requests for reconsideration of an investigation when initiated by an investigation party. Going forward, we will formalize and transparently post on an internal webpage available to all employees, the reconsideration process for investigation parties who identify any new information or information that was not considered during the investigation. The Workplace Investigations Team will implement this recommendation by December 31, 2022.

Investigation Survey: In March 2022, the company launched a survey to request feedback from employees who raise and respond to concerns to learn about their investigation experience. We plan to continue surveying investigation parties and will consider additional questions that will help us understand the employee experience. Utilizing survey data, we will consider potential connections to existing listening systems to improve insights and draw connections. Through our Employee Relations Steering Committee, we will create a regular review of aggregated feedback to inform action planning and continued improvements to our investigations process. The Workplace Investigations Team and the Global Employee Relations Team will implement this recommendation by March 31, 2023.

Investigative Process: In 2021, the company developed new investigation outcomes intended to address behaviors that are inconsistent with Microsoft’s values of respect, integrity and accountability but do not violate the Anti-Harassment and Anti-Discrimination policy. To create greater clarity with our employees on possible investigation outcomes, we will reconsider the terminology for substantiated policy violations and behavioral concerns. We will also provide additional training for Workplace Investigators and Global Employee Relations specialists on communicating those outcomes. The Workplace Investigations Team and the Global Employee Relations Team will implement this recommendation by December 31, 2022.

Post-Investigation Action and Employee Experience: In 2020, the company developed disciplinary guidelines for more principled and consistent decision-making. We will develop an auditing process to ensure that discipline is implemented and/or that HR follow up occurs by March 31, 2023. To reinforce Microsoft’s policy prohibitions against retaliation, we want to ensure that complainants in investigations do not fear negative consequences based on having raised a concern or participated in an investigation. We will take additional measures to make our employees aware of our policies. We will also consider ways in which we can strengthen our internal HR processes and communications to address perceptions of negative career impact. The Global Employee Relations Team will implement an auditing process by March 31, 2023, and additional measures with HR and Legal, also by March 31, 2023.

Leadership Accountability: We will implement changes to emphasize that senior leaders will continue to be held accountable for substantiated policy violations and behavioral concerns. These changes will include more regular reporting and expanded use of data and analytics by the Workplace Investigation Team and Global Employee Relations Team to earlier identify challenges and trends for use by the corporate Senior Leadership Team in discussions on talent, culture and acceptable leadership behavior. We will also develop a new cross-function process for discipline decision-making in investigations involving senior leaders and implement by December 31, 2022. The Workplace Investigations Team and the Global Employee Relations Team will implement the reporting aspect of this recommendation by March 31, 2023.

Training: We will review and enhance our training tools and reminder practices to facilitate the completion of required training by all employees. We will audit to ensure accountability. HR will implement this recommendation by December 31, 2022.

Transparency: As part of our continued efforts to increase transparency regarding investigations, we will continue to report on investigations to the Board. We will also publish anonymized disciplinary action data on an internal investigations webpage, which will include an informational video on our disciplinary guidelines and ranges of outcomes. Further, we will provide greater transparency to complainants by sharing more specificity about disciplinary actions in circumstances where discipline is otherwise not visible. Finally, we will begin annual public reporting on Microsoft’s implementation of our sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, including the total number of reported sexual harassment concerns, percentage of those substantiated, and types of corrective actions taken (which span coaching and training, formal warnings, compensation impacts, demotion, and termination of employment). The Global Employee Relations Team will implement greater transparency with complainants by December 31, 2022. The Global Employee Relations Team will publish anonymized disciplinary action data and an informational video by June 30, 2023.  The Workplace Investigations Team will begin annual public reporting by December 1, 2022.

Gender Diversity in Leadership Roles: The company will continue efforts to increase the percentage of women in leadership roles.  We will maintain accountability through external and internal aspirational goals and our continued commitment to highlight, discuss, develop and promote our internal and external female talent. The Senior Leadership Team will also continue with regular discussions on talent with a robust focus on growing and developing future senior leaders. We will also continue to focus on our talent sourcing and bench and our development programs to ensure we are continuing to create opportunities for women.  This work is already in progress and a focus on diversity will be an ongoing company priority. While there is not an end date for diversity-related aspirations like this, HR will report to the Senior Leadership Team on progress at least quarterly and at the end of the fiscal year.

Data & Systems Improvements: Investigations data and systems currently reside in separate tools. We will improve the coordination of the data systems and analytics by developing a plan for integrated tools for reporting and insights across the Legal Compliance and HR functions. The increased coordination will enable greater insights with speed and informed decision-making regarding investigations and culture. The Workplace Investigation Team and Global Employee Relations Team will implement enhanced coordinated reporting to the Microsoft Board of Directors by December 1, 2022, and improved coordination of data systems and analytics by June 30, 2023.

The leader of the Workplace Investigations Team (WIT) and the leader of the Global Employee Relations Team (GER) will be accountable for implementing the plan, with support from other key senior stakeholders in the Human Resources and Legal functions. Microsoft commits to complete this action plan by the close of fiscal year 2023, with some recommendations completed by the earlier dates noted above. The management implementation team will provide progress updates to the Chief People Officer and the company’s Vice Chair and President on a quarterly basis and will provide a completion report to the Board of Directors at the conclusion of the fiscal year.

As a result of this report and actions, we are confident that the implementation of these recommendations will not only address the specific concerns raised by ArentFox’s review, but will also allow us to build a stronger, more inclusive and equitable work environment for our employees moving forward. We look forward to continued growth and progress in these areas in order to maintain a culture where all of our employees can thrive.

The path to marketplace success starts here,"Today, I am honored to kick off our inaugural Marketplace Summit. For the first time, we are welcoming thousands of independent software vendors (ISVs) and Software as a service (SaaS) providers as we broadcast live from Microsoft Studios to share how we are committed to our shared success by helping ISVs maximize the marketplace opportunity.

The mass migration to the cloud since the pandemic is forcing an inflection point where customers are looking to optimize and streamline their investments — this creates an opportunity for SaaS providers and ISVs. Because of this growing demand for SaaS services, we are firmly committed to provide the right resources, tools and support to take advantage of these opportunities. Today, we are thrilled to announce the global public preview of the ISV Success Program. We are excited to offer this personalized support at the solution level and support every ISV to innovate on the Microsoft Cloud and rapidly go-to-market through the commercial marketplace.

Creating scalable growth models for ISVs
Marketplace is at the core of the ISV Success program as we aim to help every ISV not only build on the Microsoft Cloud but go-to-market with Microsoft and sell through the commercial marketplace.

In an uncertain economic environment cloud budgets are durable and still on an upward trajectory. Cloud marketplaces are outpacing cloud growth and are becoming the centralized go-to-market channel of the future. According to Tackle’s 2022 annual State of Cloud Marketplaces report, cloud marketplaces continue to generate more revenue year over year and Bessemer Venture Partners noted that in 2021, marketplace transactions grew an estimated 70% to $4 billion, which is 3x faster growth than the public cloud at large.

With the cloud embedded into every business, there is massive opportunity for any company selling SaaS or cloud-based solutions, but it’s becoming harder and harder for ISVs to differentiate and acquire new customers. Those who embrace the marketplace and are strategically executing a marketplace-first, go-to-market approach are seeing the most cost-effective growth. At Microsoft the marketplace continues to become central to how we connect customers and partners at scale and ISVs of all sizes and maturity find success when they build a cloud-centric, go-to-market strategy.

“Wiz was born in the cloud and our ecosystem is built around the marketplace motion,” says Trish Cagliostro, Head of Worldwide Channels and Alliances at Wiz. “When we work with customers in the marketplace, they usually have cloud consumption commitments through their Microsoft contracts. They can use this to consolidate IT spend and reduce total cost of ownership, which is powerful and gives Wiz the opportunity to have elevated conversations with customers.”

To support every ISV in harnessing the growing cloud opportunity, Microsoft is investing in programs and benefits across the Microsoft commercial marketplace. We are making concrete investments in programs that can benefit all ISVs, regardless of their size, scope or history. Over the past year, the marketplace has matured into a thriving commerce environment. We’ve seen:

288% growth in SaaS-billed sales
319% increase in customers with consumption commitments buying via marketplace
200% increase in private offers sold by Cloud Solution Providers

This momentum continues as customers look to centralize their cloud portfolio through B2B marketplaces to increase efficiency, buy with confidence, and spend smarter. Some of the recent marketplace innovations include:

Enterprise deal making
With 95% of the Fortune 500 using Azure, Microsoft has direct access to enterprise customers and through the marketplace, we can unlock access to these customers. We’ve seen a 164% increase in enterprise sales through the marketplace, and this will continue to grow with our commitment to partner success. Furthermore, Microsoft is unique in that we offer every dollar of cloud spend to count toward a customer’s cloud consumption commitment when they buy an eligible solution. This, paired with our enhancements to private offers and multi-year SaaS functionality, is cutting through procurement red tape and closing 7- and 8- digit deals regularly through the marketplace.

Empowering the ecosystem
Microsoft has always been a partner-focused organization. As customer needs continue to evolve, Microsoft commercial marketplace is empowering our ecosystem of over 400,000 partners around the world to work together at a faster pace, on a larger scale and on their terms. Earlier this year, we announced the general availability of margin sharing. ISV partners can create private offers and extend a margin to scale through partners in the Cloud Solution Provider program. With margin sharing, SaaS providers and ISVs can extend their sales forces and reach new markets.

To further enhance the ability for all partners to work together, we also announced that multi-party partner private offers will soon be entering private preview. This additional functionality will empower any set of partners to come together, create personalized offers with customized payouts, sell directly to Microsoft customers through marketplace and have the sale count toward the customers’ cloud consumption commitment. This will pioneer new opportunities for every partner and we look forward to sharing more details in the coming months.

The value of partnership
Only through co-innovating and jointly going to market can we truly meet customers where they are — and that synergy is the goal of the commercial marketplace. According to IDC, partners that build their own software and services are the most profitable high-growth partner business model. They estimate for every $1 of Microsoft revenue, $10.11 is made for partners that build software — 25% more than the estimates for services-led partners.

From the beginning, Microsoft has been a partner-first company. And as Microsoft’s portfolio has grown, we’ve increased our focus to ensure that our partners can access all of the innovation we create through our research and development investments, as well as to deliver their own services and solutions on top of that innovation.

Today marks an important milestone as we commit to supporting every ISV in their growth with Microsoft with the ISV Success Program and the variety of other tools and resources we outlined to support ISV success. For more details, Anthony Joseph, vice president for Marketplace and ISV Journey, covers the opportunity with the ISV Success Program on the Azure blog channel. We are excited to work side-by-side with the ISV and SaaS community to realize all the potential of building on the Microsoft Cloud and selling through the commercial marketplace.

"Introducing the Microsoft Supply Chain Platform, a new approach to designing supply chains for agility, automation and sustainability","
		Although supply chain disruption is not new, its complexity and the rate of change are outpacing organizations’ ability to address issues at a global scale. Many solutions today are narrowly focused on supply chain execution and management and are not ready to support this new reality. Enterprises are dealing with petabytes of data, spread across legacy systems, Enterprise Resource Planning programs (ERPs), and custom solutions, resulting in a fragmented view of their supply chain.
An organization’s supply chain agility and resilience will be determined by how they can connect their data and orchestrate actions across all relevant systems to quickly respond to changing market conditions. To be truly agile, supply chain software needs to increase visibility across data sources, predict and mitigate disruption, streamline collaboration, and fulfill orders – sustainably and securely.
Today we are announcing the Microsoft Supply Chain Platform, which helps organizations maximize their existing supply chain investments with an open approach, bringing the best of Microsoft AI, collaboration, low code, security, and Software as a Service (SaaS) applications to a composable platform. As part of the new Microsoft Supply Chain Platform, we are also announcing the preview of Microsoft Supply Chain Center. The Supply Chain Center empowers customers to get started quickly with a ready-made “command center” that natively works with existing supply chain data and applications.
The Microsoft Supply Chain Platform: An open, collaborative and composable foundation for data and supply chain orchestration
Across Microsoft, we deliver a breadth of capabilities for organizations such as Grupo Bimbo, Mercedes Benz and Tillamook to build their own custom supply chain solutions. With today’s announcement, we are making it easier for customers to leverage the full Microsoft Cloud to enhance their supply chain. The Microsoft Supply Chain Platform provides building blocks across Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams and the Power Platform for customers to adopt capabilities that address their specific supply chain needs. With Dataverse, customers can use hundreds of data connectors to gain visibility and act across their supply chain. The Power Platform also enables custom workflows, data reporting, and applications that connect to existing Supply Chain systems.
Partnering to empower customers in supply chain transformation
The Microsoft partner ecosystem will continue to play a critical role in enabling customer supply chain resiliency and agility. With the Microsoft Supply Chain Platform, partners can bring their industry and domain expertise to create integrated solutions leveraging Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Teams and the Power Platform. A rich supply chain partner ecosystem includes advisors and implementers like Accenture, Avanade, EY, KPMG, PwC and TCS. In addition, to help customers find the best solution for their supply chain needs, the Microsoft Supply Chain Platform connects to Blue Yonder, Cosmo Tech, Experlogix, Flintfox, InVia Robotics, K3, O9 Solutions, SAS, Sonata Software, To-Increase and many more.
Accelerating business agility and efficiency with the Microsoft Supply Chain Center
At the core of the Supply Chain Platform is the Microsoft Supply Chain Center, now available in preview. The Supply Chain Center provides a “command center” experience for practitioners to harmonize data from across existing supply chain systems, like Dynamics 365 and other ERP providers including SAP and Oracle, along with stand-alone supply chain systems. Data Manager in Supply Chain Center enables data ingestion and orchestration to provide visibility across the supply chain and drive action back into systems of execution. During preview, our launch partners C.H. Robinson, FedEx, FourKites and Overhaul, will offer native experiences within the Supply Chain Center.
Existing Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management customers will automatically gain access to the Supply Chain Center as part of their current agreements. The Supply Chain Center includes pre-built modules that address supply chain disruptions across supply and order fulfillment, as outlined below:

The supply and demand insights module uses advanced Azure AI models to predict upstream supply constraints and shortages through supply intelligence. Organizations can perform simulations using data from their supply chain network to predict being out of stock, over-stocking or missed-order lines. Combined with smart news insights, which provides relevant news alerts in the Supply Chain Center on external events, supply chain practitioners can make decisions and plan with real-world event information and historical insights for product demands.
The order management module in Supply Chain Center intelligently orchestrates and automates fulfillment with a rules-based system using real-time omnichannel inventory data, AI and machine learning. Organizations can quickly meet future order volumes and fulfillment complexities by extending their capabilities with pre-built connectors to specialized technology partners for order intake, delivery and third-party logistics services. Existing Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management customers will automatically get access to Supply Chain Center and the order management module at launch.
With secure, built-in Teams integration, customers can mitigate supply constraints by collaborating with external suppliers in real time to secure new supply sources, troubleshoot transportation issues and communicate up and downstream impacts based on changes.
By having partner modules built into the Supply Chain Center, customers can easily unlock specific solutions like freight visibility from Overhaul. Since everything runs off Dataverse, the data is consistent no matter what module you are using.

Building sustainable supply chains with Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability
Sustainable supply chains are one of the biggest opportunities for organizations to reduce their carbon footprint. However, it is one of the most challenging areas to address because decision makers lack the data and insights to optimize the selection of suppliers, routes, fulfillment and products. Using capabilities from Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management and Order Management in the Supply Chain Center, customers can make sustainable decisions on product sourcing, package-free returns, transportation logistics, manufacturing and warehouse automation and more.
Last month at Microsoft Ignite, we introduced new capabilities in Sustainability Manager, a Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability solution, which enables organizations to reduce indirect value chain emissions (also known as “Scope 3” emissions), which account for a disproportionate share of most organizations’ carbon footprints. The solution already includes prebuilt calculation methodologies for more than half of the 15 categories of Scope 3.
Reimagine your supply chain with Microsoft
We believe supply chain agility is critical to persevere in today’s economic climate. This means understanding and taking real-time actions based on supply chain data, securely and with sustainable business practices. We’re excited to deliver on this first step in our commitment to reimagine the supply chain with our customers and partners.

Azure Space helps bring ubiquitous connectivity and rapid insights from space for national security missions,"A critical priority for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is accelerating the speed at which information is collected, analyzed and delivered to where it is needed to support mission goals. Satellites are increasingly playing an important role in this ability to harness and move data around the world, but limitations in the current government architecture can still present challenges to getting information where it’s needed, when it’s needed. To solve this, the DoD’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has partnered with the U.S. Space Force in developing a Hybrid Space Architecture (HSA), designed to rapidly scale available space resources and bring together the best capabilities across government and commercial industry to establish ubiquitous, resilient connectivity and insights for mission leaders.

Today, DIU announced that Microsoft has been selected to bring our advanced, trusted cloud and innovative Azure Space capabilities, alongside a space partner ecosystem, to serve as a foundation to realize their Hybrid Space Architecture vision.

The HSA is essentially DoD’s effort to build an internet in space and will support the Department’s goal of establishing information advantage for national security. By collaborating with commercial partners, HSA vastly expands its range of satellite and space systems across diverse orbits, ground stations and communication paths to provide “secure, assured and low-latency data communications anywhere on and off Earth.”

The HSA will be built in part upon Microsoft Azure and will leverage key capabilities from our suite of Azure Space solutions, including Azure Orbital Cloud Access and Azure Orbital Ground Station. This will be supported by Microsoft’s private global wide area network, which provides resilient global data transport from ground stations to the appropriate cloud destinations. Combined, these capabilities bring together key functions of the HSA including remote sensing, multi-path communications and cloud computing.

Beyond accelerating the flow of data, a key innovation of the hybrid space architecture is accelerating the speed to insights of that data. Space is one of the largest untapped data lakes (central repositories of data) in the world and mission owners will benefit from making sense of massive volumes of data to better inform decision making, beyond what they have the power to do today. With Azure, the DIU will be able bring the best practices in commercial innovation to the HSA to utilize AI and machine learning to harness data at speed and scale for operational advantage and increased efficiency — at all security classification levels.

Underpinning this effort is our focus on cybersecurity, building on Microsoft’s commitment to advance cybersecurity in space. With a broad view of the threat landscape — informed by 43 trillion threat signals analyzed daily, combined with cutting-edge AI and the human intelligence of our more than 8,500 experts, including threat hunters, forensics investigators, malware engineers and researchers — we see firsthand what organizations are facing and we’re committed to protecting our nation from rapidly evolving cyberthreats. Microsoft deploys these industry leading cybersecurity solutions across all devices, clouds, apps and platforms that are continuously updated with the latest threat intelligence insights to provide advanced, timely defenses. Our goal is to ensure that not only Microsoft, but also our partners, can adhere to the same high security standards, and can meet and exceed the U.S. government’s security requirements while keeping pace with the evolving cyberthreat landscape.

Another key enabler in our approach to HSA is tapping into our extensive Azure Space partner ecosystem. We have developed partnerships with leading space industry companies to support the goals of HSA. Developing relationships with these partners helps the industry and government further establish a standardized approach to connectivity and ensure system interoperability across the platform. We are bringing this wide-ranging connected ecosystem to bear to support the HSA vision.

The Hybrid Space Architecture program is a demonstration of what’s possible when government and industry work closely to tackle the biggest challenges in the universe — crafting a transformational platform to support space-based national security missions. By bringing the latest Azure Space capabilities to this project, establishing consistent standards across industry, and collaborating with numerous industry partners, we’re demonstrating the art of possible to support advanced and secure space-based data connectivity and analytics.

2022 Diversity & Inclusion Report: Driving progress through greater accountability and transparency,"
		Today I am sharing Microsoft’s 2022 Global Diversity & Inclusion Report, our fourth annual report and our ninth year of releasing our global workforce demographic data. This year’s data shows that globally we are a more diverse Microsoft overall today than we have ever been, with the highest year-over-year representation progress of the past five-year period for many employee communities. We’re motivated by our ongoing progress, and this year’s growth feels particularly meaningful in the context of significant challenges around the world.
As one of the most transparent companies of our size when it comes to the diversity and inclusion data we share, we are continually evaluating where we are now and where we aspire to be. This year, in addition to the extensive data we usually share, we’re adding new data on U.S. populations that include multiracial employees and those with military experience, as well as data on workforce exits by women and men globally and race and ethnicity in the U.S., and more detail on representation of women worldwide by geographic regions. We are also sharing additional pay analysis data to further highlight the opportunity for us to continue to make progress on representation at all levels of the company.
Key highlights:

For the first time, women now make up more than 30% of the Microsoft’s core* workforce worldwide at 30.7%, up 1.0 percentage point since last year. Since 2018, representation of women has grown at least 1.0 percentage point every year.
At Microsoft, we are committed to the principle of pay equity. Pay equity accounts for factors that legitimately influence total pay, including things like job title, level and tenure. As of September 2022:

Inside the U.S., all racial and ethnic minorities who are rewards eligible combined earn $1.008 total pay for every $1.000 earned by U.S. rewards-eligible white employees with the same job title and level and considering tenure.
Inside the U.S., women who are rewards eligible earn $1.007 total pay for every $1.000 earned by rewards-eligible employees who are men and have the same job title and level and considering tenure.
Outside the U.S., women who are rewards eligible earn $1.002 total pay for every $1.000 earned by men who are rewards eligible with the same job title and level and considering tenure in the combined geographies we report on.


Employees from racial and ethnic minority communities now make up 53.2% of Microsoft’s core U.S. workforce, up 1.9 percentage points from last year.
Representation across Asian, Black and African American, Hispanic and Latinx, and multiracial employee populations in our core U.S. workforce has increased for each group since last year:

Asian representation has grown by 0.3 percentage points to 35.8%, and has grown by 3.9 percentage points since 2018.
Black and African American representation grew 0.9 percentage points to 6.6%, the highest year-over-year increase in the past five years.
Hispanic and Latinx representation grew 0.6 percentage points to 7.6%, the highest year-over-year increase in the past five years.
Multiracial representation is 2.6%, up 0.1 percentage point from last year.


We’re energized by our strides toward fulfilling our commitment made in 2020 to double the number of Black and African American and Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior individual contributors and senior leaders in the U.S. by 2025 as part of our Racial Equity Initiative.

For Black and African American people managers (below Director level), we’re 116.0% of the way to our 2025 commitment.
For Black and African American Directors, Partners and Executives — including people managers and individual contributors — we’re 92.0% of the way to our commitment.
For Hispanic and Latinx people managers (below Director level), we’re 46.5% of the way to our commitment.
For Hispanic and Latinx Directors, Partners and Executives — including people managers and individual contributors — we’re 57.6% of the way to our commitment.


7.8% of employees in the U.S. self-identified as having a disability. This is an increase of 0.7 percentage points from last year.

This year, we added new reporting to continue to evolve how we reflect the many dimensions of identity within our workforce and to deepen transparency on our progress. For the first time, we’re sharing:

New dimensions of self-identification: We’ve added details on the population of U.S. employees who identify as multiracial. Increasing employees’ options to be more specific about their racial and ethnic identities helps us gather more actionable data, and we’ve heard from employees that having these options can help people feel more seen and included in the workplace. We’ve also expanded options for Asian employees in the U.S. to identify their backgrounds in further detail. The Asian community is the single largest racial and ethnic minority group within our company, encompassing more than 20 sub-identities. We aim to expand the detail we share in future reports once we have representative participation in this additional layer of self-identification.
Representation of U.S. employees with military status: Microsoft employs thousands of veterans and reserve service members around the world, and we offer employees the choice to identify as a person with military experience in 38 countries including the U.S. This data helps us to create more visibility for members of the Microsoft military community and better understand and support the diversity of our workforce. This year’s report shows that 4.7% of U.S. employees in our core Microsoft business self-identified as having served the U.S. Armed Forces or as having Protected Veteran status, a 0.4 percentage point increase from 2021. We aim to expand the detail we share in future reports once we have representative participation globally.
Workforce exits data: This year, for the first time, we’re reporting data on workforce exits of employees who have left Microsoft voluntarily or involuntarily. This reporting shows exits representation has declined 0.2 percentage points year over year for women globally. In the U.S., for Black and African American employees, exits representation has declined 0.3 percentage points year over year. Exits representation in the U.S. rose for Asian (5.1 percentage points), Hispanic and Latinx (0.4 percentage points), Native American and Alaska Native (0.2 percentage points), and multiracial (0.3 percentage points) employees since last year. Exits representation for Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander employees was unchanged year over year.
Additional pay data: We have reported on pay equity since 2016 in support of our commitment to pay employees equitably for substantially similar work. While pay equity is a critical factor, it is only one factor in how we think about progress. To further highlight the opportunity to continue to make progress on representation at all levels of the company, we have chosen this moment to be even more transparent and also voluntarily disclose the unadjusted differences in median total pay for women inside and outside of the U.S., and for racial and ethnic minorities, Asian, Black and African American, and Hispanic and Latinx employees in the U.S. The median is the middle value of a data set. Therefore, median pay for a group of employees represents the value where half of the employees in that group are paid higher than that point and half of the employees in that group are paid lower. This analysis allows us to surface differences in median pay when we don’t adjust for things like job title, level, and tenure. As we continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce. View additional pay data on page 30 of the report.

This year’s report also explores how we innovate for inclusion, setting the standard on accountability and transparency, advocating for employees and communities globally, and continuing to broaden career pathways into our industry.

The work of diversity and inclusion at Microsoft isn’t about a pledge or a performance, but about being deeply connected to the powerful impact on our lived experience when the people we spend our workdays with value inclusion and embrace difference. This is one of the reasons we are encouraged by what our employee sentiment measurement tells us. This year, for instance, when asked whether they feel included in their teams, employees responded to this companywide survey question with an average score of 86 globally.
As we maintain our momentum on increasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion, we’ll continue to listen, we’ll continue to learn and just as importantly, we’ll continue to act.
*Core Microsoft business represents 83.9% of the worldwide broader Microsoft workforce and does not include our minimally integrated companies.

Our commitment to making the new Image Creator from Microsoft Bing fun and inclusive for everyone,"Last week, we announced our new creator tools in Microsoft 365, Microsoft Bing and Edge, designed to help ignite people’s imaginations and express themselves. Today, Image Creator from Microsoft Bing begins rolling out in a limited preview to select markets and will be coming soon to Microsoft Edge. To learn more about how Image Creator works, check out this post from the Bing team.

As I mentioned in last week’s announcement, we are in the early stages of bringing DALL.E 2 by OpenAI to these experiences. We are in limited preview with the Microsoft Designer app and today we are beginning to roll out Image Creator in Bing to a small set of geographies. We are intentionally taking our time to ensure we gather feedback, learn and apply those learnings before rolling things out more broadly.

The rollout of DALL∙E 2 across Microsoft products and services reflects how the company’s investment in AI research is helping to thoughtfully infuse AI into everything it builds, produces and delivers to help everyone boost productivity and innovation. And we recognize there’s still important work to do. At Microsoft, our teams are focused on the development of tools and techniques that guide people toward the appropriate and responsible use of AI tools, such as DALL∙E 2 in Image Creator.  And to curb misuse, we are implementing precautions and moderation policies.

For example, OpenAI has made their content filters more robust over time so that they are more effective at blocking images that violate their content policy – which is designed to block generations that include violent, adult or political content, among other categories – while still allowing creative expression. In addition, we will not show any of the text strings used as input within the images created and we may distort faces, all as part of our commitment to responsible AI. We are working closely with OpenAI to build, test and review mitigations for our integrations.

As we begin this journey together, we look forward to working with our customers, researchers and the global community to continuously improve and we welcome feedback, ideas or concerns. We’re excited about the potential this technology holds to help everyone better express themselves and their ideas.

Microsoft Ignite: A showcase of products to help customers be more efficient and productive,"The past few years have been a period of dramatic change, with disruptions to our society, the global economy, political landscape, technology and the way we work. As organizations adapt to new challenges, they are turning to their technology providers to help them succeed.

Against this backdrop, at this year’s Microsoft Ignite we are focused on how Microsoft Cloud is helping customers do more with less. In today’s uncertain economic environment, companies are looking to change the way they do work to get better results, with less friction and more choice.

Microsoft Ignite is a showcase of the best of what’s next for Microsoft and its partners, technical decision-makers and information technology implementers. The products and updates unveiled during Microsoft Ignite are designed to help customers, partners and developers get the full value of Microsoft’s technologies.

At every layer of the tech stack – whether it’s infrastructure, data, hybrid work, developer tools or security – we believe the Microsoft Cloud offers best-of-category products and best-of-suite solutions to help organizations be more secure, and to help their workers complete their tasks more easily and effectively.

We know that things become most useful to businesses when they become part of ordinary workflows, which is why we’ve made huge investments in our overall AI technology, in Microsoft 365, in our developer tools, in the Microsoft Cloud and in our security offerings. These are all things that are important to our customers, and so we’re aligning our resources to better help them.

Now, let’s dive into some of the more than 100 services and updates being announced at Microsoft Ignite.

Infrastructure that works for every customer

When we introduced the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform earlier this year, we set out to unify Microsoft’s database, analytics and data governance offerings so our customers didn’t have to. We removed a major pain point around stitching together fragmented data workloads, enabling customers to gain quicker business insights and spend time on what matters most. That platform is now expanding, with 12 partners joining the ecosystem.

Our enterprise-grade, highly scalable, serverless distributed database Azure Cosmos DB already helps mission-critical applications of any size or scale deliver speed and availability to users anywhere in the world, increasing geographic availability, scalability and distribution.

Now, we’re adding distributed database support for PostgreSQL, a popular open-source database engine. This means PostgreSQL developers can take advantage of the speed, scale and performance of Azure Cosmos DB, and open-source developers can access both structured and unstructured data in one familiar database service.

With our hybrid and multicloud offerings, we’re enabling customers to take advantage of the capabilities of Azure wherever they are, whether that’s new functionality to deploy Azure Kubernetes Service on-premises or at the edge with Azure Arc. We’re also continuing to invest in the infrastructure that carries it all, with Azure public multi-access edge compute. It’s helping operators like AT&T deliver 5G in U.S. cities.

We’re also announcing Visual Studio images for Microsoft Dev Box, a service in preview that provides developers with cloud-based, ready-to-code workstations. With Visual Studio available as soon as a developer creates a dev box, developers can save time and focus on coding what matters.

Harnessing the power of AI

Azure OpenAI Service, part of the Azure AI platform, will offer invite-only access to DALL∙E 2, a model that allows users to generate custom images using text or images. The addition of the DALL∙E 2 model expands the breadth-of-use cases Azure OpenAI Service customers can employ with the security, compliance and responsible AI guardrails that Azure provides. Select customers will be able to generate content, images and code to bring visual ideas to life – all from inputting simple text.

With Power Automate, Microsoft is simplifying workflows using the power of AI in everyday natural language. Users can create a cloud flow that corresponds to the request made using natural language. Here, AI helps to turn low-code into no-code, making it easier for more people to build different types of automation faster.

The introduction of Microsoft Syntex integrates offerings from across the Microsoft Cloud, from Microsoft 365 and Azure to Power Platform and Microsoft Purview. Syntex automatically reads, tags and indexes high volumes of content and connects it where it’s needed in context – in search, in applications and as reusable knowledge. It puts people at the center, with content integrated into collaboration and workflows like eSignature.

Microsoft Intelligent Document Processing, powered by AI Builder and Power Automate, enables end-to-end document processing with no code required. Processing documents can be a cumbersome task and AI Builder automates this process, giving workers time back to focus on more high-priority work.

With more sellers on the road and in digital meetings, we’re making conversation intelligence free for Dynamics 365 Sales Enterprise and the newly released Viva Sales. Conversation intelligence gives sellers the power of insights while helping them be more productive by using analytics and data science to help sellers cut down time spent on administrative work and spend more time with their customers.

Helping organizations thrive in the new world of work

At Microsoft Ignite we’re introducing Microsoft Places, a new workplace app that optimizes the use of physical space. According to our recent Work Trend Index, more than 80% of employees go into the office for each other. Places provides insights into when colleagues are coming into the office or what meetings are best suited for in person.

You’ll also see intelligent recap, which is like having a virtual assistant at every meeting. It will use AI to assign tasks from meetings, automatically generate chapters from the meeting and share personalized insights from the recording, enabling users to discover information that matters most to them. Intelligent recap, along with other new features, will be delivered as part of the new Teams Premium add-on, purchased separately.

With Microsoft Edge we are continuing to invest in distinct experiences that make the workday easier. Microsoft Edge Workspaces is a shared set of browser tabs where groups can view the same websites and latest working files in one place. For example, let’s say a new team member is being brought on to an existing project. Instead of overwhelming them with links and files over email, the team can share one link to their Microsoft Edge Workspaces, which has all their relevant files and links open as browser tabs. As the team works together, tabs are updated in real time so everyone stays on the same page.

Comprehensive security means helping protect everyone wherever they choose to work

The new Defender for DevOps tackles one of the biggest problems faced by the tech industry – new and legacy code not written with security in mind, which can be rapidly exploited by attackers.  Organizations can secure applications as they are being built, giving developers the assurance that when they get code from external sources or are working with large application teams, they know they can get ahead of security vulnerabilities and deliver a more secure solution.

We are also offering Power Platform Managed Environments, which enables organizations to introduce low code broadly to spur innovation with the knowledge that IT admins maintain governance and security capabilities over low-code implementations, allowing teams to create at scale without security concerns.

Microsoft is helping organizations build the identity system of the future, a connective network that enables people, organizations, apps and even smart devices to make real-time access decisions.

With Microsoft Entra we are introducing identity and access management solutions designed to securely work across multiple cloud platforms. Microsoft Entra Identity Governance helps organizations ensure the right people have the right access to the right resources at the right time. Within Entra Identity Governance, Workload Identities controls and secures identities for digital workloads, such as apps and services, and controls user access to cloud resources, while certificate-based authentication enables customers to adopt easily deployable phishing-resistant authentication.

Microsoft and Meta partner to deliver immersive experiences for the future of work and play,"As companies and employees settle into new work norms post-pandemic, we’re living through a once-in-a-lifetime shift in work patterns. Whether work happens from home, at the office, in a warehouse or on the go, work is no longer a place, but an experience that transcends place and time.

Over the past two-and-a-half years, new patterns of work have emerged that put people, communications, and workflows at the center. In that time, Microsoft Teams has grown to 270 million monthly active users, becoming the most ubiquitous platform for workplace collaboration and business processes. Teams’ growth is a sign of how work has changed, and where it’s going.

People crave deeper, richer ways of collaborating and co-creating from wherever they are. We believe that in the not-so-distant future, the metaverse will play a key role in providing new ways of connecting. In fact, our Work Trend Index data shows that 50% of Gen Z and millennials envision doing some of their work in the metaverse in the next two years.

As a platform company, our approach to workplace productivity and collaboration is to ensure the software experiences we deliver can benefit users on all their favorite devices. In that spirit, today we are announcing several ways we are partnering with Meta to provide customers with more choice and security as they venture into the metaverse.

First, we are bringing Mesh for Microsoft Teams to Meta Quest devices. Mesh for Teams builds on years of research and Microsoft Cloud innovation, from Azure Digital Twins to Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and Teams video meetings. It is designed to help people gather virtually in the place where work happens on any device, including smartphones, laptops and mixed-reality headsets. Mesh for Teams with Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 2 devices will enable people to connect and collaborate as though they are together in person.

In addition, Microsoft 365 apps will be available on Meta Quest devices, enabling people to interact with content from their favorite productivity apps including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and SharePoint within VR. In the future, Windows 365 will also be available on Meta Quest devices, with the ability to stream a Windows Cloud PC including your personalized apps, content and settings.

Microsoft Intune and Azure Active Directory will support Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 2, enabling IT administrators to provision these devices for users with a Quest for Business subscription from Meta, with confidence so that the security and management options they expect from PCs and mobile devices will carry over to VR.

Finally, Microsoft and Meta are exploring ways to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to Meta Quest Store, allowing gamers to stream hundreds of high-quality Xbox games to phones, tablets, PCs, select smart TVs, and the Meta Quest platform.

This partnership complements our commitment to HoloLens, and we are excited to continue evolving our mixed-reality devices roadmap, leading with our cloud-first approach, and with Windows and Microsoft 365 at the fore. All of this advances our efforts to build the foundations of a responsible metaverse, with security, compliance and enterprise-grade experiences as foundational to how we will continue to unlock new possibilities for the future of work.

Bridging the employer-employee disconnect,"This morning in London, I sat down with Satya Nadella and Ryan Roslansky, LinkedIn’s CEO, to discuss how leaders can empower employees — and drive business impact — in the face of economic uncertainty. No matter how your people work, from remote to in-person to somewhere in between, understanding your workforce is more important than ever.

The world has changed, and anyone who thinks we’re going back to the way we worked in 2019 is sorely mistaken. It’s become clear to us that work is no longer a place, but an experience that binds employees and leaders across home offices, company headquarters, time zones and more. Employees around the world have embraced flexibility and hybrid work schedules, reveling in the freedom to work where, when and how they want. At the same time, many leaders still crave the familiarity of the traditional office where brainstorming happened in person and chance encounters in the hallways led to unexpected collaboration. In short, there’s a disconnect between employers and employees. And in an unpredictable economy, that disconnect is only growing wider.

The solution? A new approach to employee engagement, one that embraces the digitally connected, distributed workforce, realigns employees to business priorities and re-onboards them to the company culture and mission. In our latest Work Trend Index Pulse Report, out today, we offer three urgent pivots leaders must make to bridge the divide — and help employees not only do their best, but be their best.

“Thriving employees are what will give organizations a competitive advantage in today’s dynamic economic environment,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft Chairman and CEO. “Today, we’re announcing new innovations across our employee experience platform Microsoft Viva to help leaders end productivity paranoia, rebuild social capital, and re-recruit and re-energize their employees.”

Let’s dive in.

Measure what matters

Many leaders used to rely on the visibility of the office to assess organizational productivity, hearing the click of keyboards and seeing the long hours at desks. In the shift to hybrid work, 85% of leaders say they have a hard time knowing for sure that their people are being productive. Yet whether they were working remotely, in person, or a mix of both, 87% of employees say they are productive at work. That fear has led some companies to institute digital monitoring, tracking trivial metrics to assuage their angst.

It can be stressful to trust that your people are working when you can’t see them. And all employees need metrics to gauge their on-the-job performance. But rather than relying on productivity theater, leaders must focus on impact, or what employees do that matters. Giving employees clarity on what work drives impact is even more essential now, as nearly half of workers say they’re burned out. This should alarm every leader, as burnout not only stifles employee well-being, but also chokes off innovation and decimates retention.

To start, listen to your people. It sounds simple, but more than half of companies (57%) rarely, if ever, hear about their employees’ experiences at work. Actionable employee insights are critical to keeping a pulse on your organization — and hearing feedback can help you catch issues before they reach a breaking point that costs you talent, time and money.

At Microsoft, we’re dialing up new ways to help leaders drive clarity and alignment, eliminate time-wasting busywork, and determine what is getting in the way of your people making a real impact. Today we are introducing Viva Pulse, a new app that will enable managers and team leads to seek regular and confidential feedback on their team’s experience. Viva Pulse uses smart templates and research-backed questions to help managers pinpoint what’s working well and where to focus, and also provides suggested learning and actions to address team needs. This is complementary and additive to robust company-wide engagement tools like Glint, which will be coming to Viva next year.

And earlier this year, we launched Viva Goals, a new goal-setting framework that helps organizations align employee work to business outcomes. New integrations in Viva Goals help bring goals into the flow of work, including an enhanced Microsoft Teams app to check in and collaborate on Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), an integration with Azure DevOps to automatically update work items, a connection to Power BI datasets to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Results, and integrations with Microsoft Planner and Project for automatic project management updates.

Stay connected in and out of the office

The number of organizations that have rolled back their return-to-office mandates is proof that people need a better reason to come into the office than policy alone. The data shows that the reason they will come in actually benefits organizations: People, we found, come in for each other. Eighty-four percent of employees say they’d be motivated to go to the office to socialize with coworkers, while 85% are motivated by rebuilding team bonds. The data underscores we have a deep human need to connect with the people we associate with, and that spending time together can help us build stronger relationships — which are key to doing our best work.

Firms desperately need to rebuild that social capital. Half of employees say their relationships outside their immediate teams have frayed, and 43% say they feel disconnected from their company. In a hybrid world, leaders need to think beyond the office, too: No matter where your employees work, consistent communication and connection is critical to help them feel like they’re part of a community.

In addition to optimizing office space for time together, a digital employee experience ensures employees can stay connected and engaged when working apart. We’re introducing Viva Amplify, a new app that empowers employee communications teams and leaders to elevate their messages and reach employees where they are with consistency and impact. The app centralizes communications campaigns, offers writing guidance to improve message resonance, enables publishing across multiple channels and distribution groups in Microsoft 365 and provides metrics for improvement.

We also recently launched Viva Engage, an app that fosters digital community building through conversations and self-expression tools. And within Viva Engage, we’re excited to announce Leadership Corner, a space where employees can interact directly with leadership, share ideas and perspectives, host “ask me anything” (AMA) events and more. Leaders can use intuitive dashboards to track metrics and employee sentiment in real time.

To help colleagues easily discover connections and collaborate across the organization, we’re introducing People in Viva, a new capability that uses AI to unlock insights across interests, knowledge and team goals. This experience will be available through Microsoft 365 profile cards and as a new app.

To retain talent, prioritize learning

Seventy-six percent of employees say that if they could benefit more from learning and development, they’d stay at their company longer. The desire for training on the job has exploded over the last few years: Employees consider opportunities to learn and grow as the No. 1 driver of great work culture, a jump from 2019 when it ranked ninth. It’s undoubtedly more cost-effective to upskill workers than hire brand new people. These findings make it clear that if you don’t invest in the talent you already have, they will leave. In a tight labor market, re-recruiting your people — and investing in their careers for the long run — could be the difference between a successful and a struggling organization.

With Viva, your workforce can master those skills right in the flow of work. The Viva Learning app makes it easy for employees to discover, share and track the latest learning content in Microsoft Teams, so a company’s entire workforce can stay up to date on required and recommended training. Enhanced integrations between Viva Learning and LinkedIn Learning will make it even easier for people to access content from LinkedIn Learning Hub right in the flow of work in Teams. Learners will see all of their LinkedIn Learning Hub content synced, including custom content, curated learning paths and the courses they have already completed, all reflected directly within Viva. And admins will be able to set the integration up directly within their settings on LinkedIn Learning Hub – no APIs needed.

And to help put collective knowledge to work for all employees, we’re introducing Answers in Viva, a new chat-like experience that uses AI to match employee questions to answers and experts across your organization.

Even more from Viva

Work can be hard, but how you work shouldn’t be. Today we’re introducing several enhancements across the Viva platform to help employees get back their time — and have more impact. To streamline the Viva experience and help employees start their day, the new Viva Connections home experience brings all Microsoft Viva apps into one place, and updates to the Viva briefing email will provide more personalized recommendations to help employees catch up on work, meetings and learning.

As we look to the future, we’re also thinking about how to tailor the employee experience to meet the unique needs of specific roles. Viva Sales, the first role-based employee experience app in the platform, will be generally available Oct. 3. Viva Sales brings together a seller’s CRM with Microsoft 365 and Teams to provide a more streamlined and AI-powered selling experience — right in the tools they’re using every day. We’re also announcing a partnership with Seismic to personalize and scale customer engagements through AI-generated content recommendations.

The world of work has fundamentally changed, and to set ourselves up for long-term success, our approach to leadership must change with it. I won’t sugarcoat it: It may be uncomfortable. Change always is. But by looking to the data and supporting employees — through clarity, connection and learning opportunities — your people and organizations will flourish.

Microsoft study: Small and medium-sized businesses growing fast by embracing digital technologies,"Eighty percent of businesses expect to be hybrid – four tips for data security and compliance.

Sustainability is the #1 ESG priority for Small and Medium Businesses – how to reduce your carbon footprint.

Early adopters of technology grow faster – practical steps to accelerate your digital journey.

Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are the cornerstone of every community. With an estimated 400 million SMBs operating worldwide, they account for 99% of global organizations. SMBs are the main source of job creation, making up between 60%-85% of employment. [1] [2]  And according to the International Labor Organization, by some estimates, SMBs contribute up to 70% of GDP.[3]

With that kind of scale and impact, SMBs need the ability to innovate to be successful and thrive in a digitally enabled economy.

During the pandemic, we saw that businesses able to accelerate their digital transformation fared better than those that did not. Many reported growth through their focus on tech intensity.

Under such unprecedented circumstances, Microsoft was curious to learn how SMBs view the current realities of their businesses, to understand their goals and priorities, and to assess whether technology is seen as a catalyst to future success.

Analysys Mason was commissioned to conduct research with over 3,000 SMBs from 10 different areas of the world, representing the global footprint of SMBs.

Today, we are releasing our findings with the Microsoft SMB Voice and Attitudes to Technology Study 2022.

Top insights

Digital technology adoption contributes to faster growth

The study confirms that nearly 70% of businesses consider growth as their primary driver, and technology “early adopters” saw faster and higher growth.  Businesses identified as early adopters are twice as likely to have achieved their past business objectives plus higher revenue growth over the past year and are also four times more likely to be highly confident in their future business success. Today, businesses are focusing on sustaining growth despite geopolitical uncertainty, high inflation and energy prices. For 51% of businesses, the ongoing impact of COVID-19 remains a concern.

Security and reliability form the foundation

More than two-thirds of SMBs plan to increase their IT budgets in the next year, prioritizing investments in the following ways:

Eighty percent of businesses expect to have a hybrid workforce for at least the next two years and require the technology to support their business goals in a reliable and secure way.

Partners help drive strategy and SMB growth

While the majority of SMBs recognize the importance of technology in reaching business goals, 16% see it as essential. However, many SMBs need partners to map the right technology to their business strategy.  Almost half choose technology partners, with 33% favoring Managed Service Providers or Cloud Solution Providers whom they expect to proactively recommend technology solutions to accelerate companies’ business goals.

The millennial factor

Millennials hold 41% of technology decision-making roles. They tend to work for newer companies and 13% are more likely to see technology as important or essential to business success. Nearly one-third of millennials identify as technophiles in their personal lives, carrying some of their consumer traits into how they research and purchase technology, placing high value on peer ratings and reviews when making purchasing decisions. In 2016, Gallup flagged that millennials favor purpose over paycheck in their How Millennials Work and Live report. Millennials as business owners apply those values to their business and technology priorities.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) goals – no longer just for the enterprise

Two-thirds of SMBs in the study report having ESG assessment and monitoring frameworks in place. Millennials are leading the way, being the most likely to have an annual report dedicated to their ESG progress. In terms of focus areas, 37% cited lowering their environmental impact, 30% wanted to improve their diversity and inclusion, while 30% were focused on job creation.  The study points to a link between an ESG focus and attainment of business objectives – with both these traits being most prevalent among early adopters.

Ninety-nine percent of the world’s businesses are actively seeking solutions to address current challenges and generate new opportunities. This community impacts economies worldwide and the livelihoods of billions. They do this not to just be resilient and survive, but to thrive and bring innovation to their industries and value to their customers. Microsoft continues to listen to and learn from our SMB customers, aligning to what is their top of mind.

Together, the possibilities are endless, and opportunity abounds for all.
